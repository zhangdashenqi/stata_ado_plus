d 'WHITE': module to perform White's test for heteroscedasticity
d 
d htest, szroeter, and white provide tests for the assumption of
d the linear regression model that the residuals e are
d homoscedastic,  i.e., have constant variance. The tests differ
d with respect to the  specification of residual variances under
d the alternative hypothesis. white considers the general
d (unrestricted) alternative hypothesis  in which no assumptions is
d made on the residual variances (White  1980). szroeter considers
d the alternative hypothesis that the residual variances are
d monotonically increasing in some variable (Szroeter  1978). htest
d performs standard score tests for H: b=0 for two parametric
d forms of heteroscedasticity: multiplicative heteroscedasticity
d and random coefficient heteroscedasticity (REF). Warning: these
d modules are a work in progress. Note: the modules htest and

d 'DENTON': module to interpolate a quarterly flow series from annual totals via proportional Denton method
d 
d denton computes the proportional Denton method of interpolation
d of an annual flow time series by use of an associated "indicator
d series",  imposing the constraints that the interpolated series
d obeys the annual  totals. The method is recommended in IMF
d publications as  "relatively simple, robust, and well-suited for
d large-scale applications." It may be particularly useful in cases
d where, due to sizable statistical discrepancy, quarterly series
d do not integrate to annual totals. The indicator series only
d contribute their pattern to the interpolation;  thus it is quite
d feasible to use both quarterly and annual flow series expressed
d at an annual rate. The interpolated series will be at a
d quarterly rate. Although the procedure is usually applied to flow
d series (such as GDP), it may be applied to stock series if they
d are differenced and then integrated via generate..sum(), after
d adding their initial value. This version of the package also
d contains dentonmq, a routine to perform the same task for monthly
d interpolation of a quarterly series.

d and the data file includes character-format date variables. The
d infile command converts these to string variables. The strdate
d command converts these to numeric date variables with the same

d 'DFAO': module to perform Dickey-Fuller unit root test in the presence of additive outliers
d 
d dfao is an extension of the dfuller routine in Stata. It performs
d the D-F unit root test when the data have additive outliers, or
d temporary one-time shocks. Such outliers give rise to moving
d average errors with negative coefficients and these in turn
d result in oversized unit root tests. The method employed here
d follows Vogelsang (1999). dfao also serves as a replacement for
d dfuller. Unlike the latter routine, DFAO conducts an automatic
d sequential t-test to determine the lag length to use in the DF
d regression (this test can be suppressed). Additionally, dfao
d calculates response surface critical values using the equations
d in Cheung and Lai (1995). dfao is for use with version 7.0 of
d Stata. This is version 1.0.7 of the software.

d 'DFGLS': module to compute Dickey-Fuller/GLS unit root test
d 
d dfgls performs the Elliott-Rothenberg-Stock (ERS, 1996) efficient
d  test for an autoregressive unit root. This test is similar to an
d  (augmented) Dickey-Fuller "t" test, as performed by dfuller, but
d  has the best overall performance in terms of small-sample size
d and  power, dominating the ordinary Dickey-Fuller test. The code
d has been  revised to calculate the optimal lag length using  a
d sequential t-test  (Ng and Perron, 1995),  the SC and the AIC.
d This is version 1.3.10 of  the software, updated from that
d published in STB-58. This version uses  doubles throughout,
d improved critical values from response surface estimation,
d corrects an error in the calculation of the Schwarz criterion,
d corrects an  error in the use of initial missing observations,
d and adds the MAIC  criterion (Ng and Perron 2001), which is much
d more appropriate than SC or  AIC in the presence of negative
d moving average components. It also adds an  option to save the
d residuals from detrending (demeaning). dfgls is now a part of
d official Stata version 8, and routine dfgls2 (for Stata 8; q.v.)
d adds the capability to estimate the test on a single unit of a
d panel.

d correlation is placed in a new variable, specified with the

d (where the start and/or end points differ across units), it does
d not allow gaps within the observations of a time series; that is,
d the value of an observation for a given period may be missing,
d but the observation itself must be defined. Gaps in time series

d hazplot.  Smoothed hazard (transition/failure) rate plots.
d Program by Kenneth L. Simons.
d hazplot plots hazard rates or smoothed hazard rates.  It works only on data in
d panel form with integer time variables, and the data must have been stset
d using the time0() option.  For example, you might have employee records with
d one line of data for each employee in each year.
d 
d Smoothing weights together observations from different points in time to
d remove noise from the data.  The smoothing is limited to within a moving
d window of plus or minus k (inclusive) units of time, and is weighted according
d to a Gaussian (normal) distribution with standard deviation sigma.  Also, it
d is possible to specify a breakpoint such that smoothed values at all points in
d time less than the breakpoint are treated independently of all points in time
d greater than or equal to the breakpoint; thus, smoothing does not take into
d account any observations from the other side of the breakpoint.  To make a
d plot smoother, increase the values of k and sigma.
d 
d The default is to smooth over a window of plus or minus one unit of time,
d weighting by a normal distribution with a standard deviation of one.  To turn
d off smoothing, specify the option k(0).
d 
d You can plot hazard rates for competing types of risk (these will be overlayed
d on graphs of up to 8 competing types of risk).  You can also plot hazard rates
d separately for multiple groups using the by() option, and if so you can either
d view the plots side-by-side or (without competing risks) use the overlay
d option to view them as a single graph with up to 8 by-groups (up to 4 with a
d graphed breakpoint).  To split the graph at the breakpoint you specified, use
d the gphbrk option (only available if overlay is on).  You can also use
d standard graph options including connect(), symbol(), and title(); you can
d have the graph sent to your printer by using the gphprint option; or you can
d list the resulting smoothed hazards by using the list option.
d 
d In this version, graphs are not labeled in a way that distinguishes types of
d risk or groups.  Sorry about this limitation and please feel free to
d reprogram the graphing to do a better job if you have the time and
d inclination!  If you are having trouble distinguishing between curves on the
d graph, it may help to use the list option to check the hazards computed for
d each risk type and by-group.  (Competing risks will not necessarily receive
d color and other line properties in any particular order, so don't use the line
d color to tell between risk types.  They will be in the some order in the plot
d as you see if you list the results.)  I have also had trouble with the
d vertical axis of graphs having numbers that can't be read because they get
d chopped off at the left edge of the graph window; if this happens, try using
d the yscale(#,#) option.  For publication, it's easy to use the list option
d and then create the graph in a spreadsheet program.
d 
d See also sthaz, a similar continuous-time module that uses kernel density
d methods to yield similar smoothed hazards and related estimates.

d 'INEQDECO': module to calculate inequality indices with decomposition by subgroup
d 
d ineqdeco estimates a range of inequality and related indices
d commonly  used by economists, plus decompositions of a subset of
d these indices by  population subgroup.  Inequality decompositions
d by subgroup are useful  for providing inequality 'profiles' at a
d point in time, and for analyzing  secular trends using
d shift-share analysis. Unit record ('micro' level) data  are
d required. Inequality indices estimated are: members of the single
d parameter Generalized Entropy class GE(a) for a = -1, 0, 1, 2;
d the Atkinson class A(e) for e = 0.5, 1, 2; the Gini coefficient,
d and the percentile ratios p90/p10 and p75/p25. Also presented are
d related summary statistics such as subgroup means and population
d shares. Optionally presented are indices  related to the Atkinson
d inequality indices, viz equally-distributed- equivalent income
d Yede(e), social welfare indices W(e), and the Sen  welfare index.
d  The inequality indices differ in their sensitivities to income
d differences in different parts of the distribution. The more
d positive a is, the more sensitive GE(a) is to income differences
d at the top of the distribution;  the more negative a is, the more
d sensitive it is to differences at the  bottom of the
d distribution. GE(0) is the mean logarithmic deviation,  GE(1) is
d the Theil index, and GE(2) is half the square of the coefficient
d of variation. The more positive e>0 (the 'inequality aversion
d parameter') is, the more sensitive A(e) is to income differences
d at the bottom of the distribution. The Gini coefficient is most
d sensitive to income differences about the middle (more precisely,
d the mode).  This version has been revised for Stata 7.0
d compatibility.

d 'FITSTAT': module to compute fit statistics for single equation regression models
d 
d fitstat is a post-estimation command that computes a variety of
d measures of fit for many kinds of regression models. It works
d after the following: clogit, cnreg, cloglog, intreg, logistic,
d logit, mlogit, nbreg, ocratio, ologit, oprobit, poisson, probit,
d regress, zinb, and zip.  With the saving() and using() options,
d it can also be used to compare fit measures for two different
d models. For all models, fitstat reports the log-likelihoods of
d the full and intercept-only models, the deviance (D), the
d likelihood ratio chi-square (G2), Akaike's Information Criterion
d (AIC), AIC*N, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and BIC'.
d For all models except regress, fitstat reports McFadden's R2,
d McFadden's adjusted R2, the maximum likelihood R2, and Cragg &
d Uhler's R2.  These measures all equal R2 for OLS regression.
d fitstat reports R2 and the adjusted R2 after regress. fitstat
d reports the regular and adjusted count R2 for categorical data
d models. For ordered or binary logit or probit models, as well as
d models for censored data (tobit, cnreg, or intreg), it also
d reports McKelvey and Zavonia's R2. In addition, it reports
d Efron's R2 for logit or probit. This is version 1.6.4 of the

d 'ONESPELL': module to generate single longest spell for each unit in panel data, listwise
d 
d onespell produces a subset of a panel data set in which all
d observations on varlist are non-missing and contiguous in the
d time dimension. If a panel unit  contains more than one such
d subset, the longest "spell" is retained.  Although performing
d this operation for a single variable of interest is fairly
d straightforward,  this routine deals with a more challenging
d task: generating the single longest spell in a listwise  fashion,
d across a set of variables. This applies the same logic as does,
d e.g., regress: an  observation with a missing value in any
d variable will be deleted from the regression sample. Some matrix
d software (e.g., DPD for Ox) requires that panel data be organized
d in this fashion,  with each unit appearing as a single contiguous
d block of non-missing observations. onespell  will produce such a
d dataset, which after conversion to Stata version 6 format  (by,
d e.g., Stat/Transfer) may be read directly by Ox. The routine has
d been tested with the latest  version of Ox (3.40) and the DPD
d package (1.21). The routine makes use of N.J. Cox's -tsspell-.

d sample,  and then repeated, dropping initial observations until
d that number of observations have been excluded. All three forms
d of the command generate timeseries of R^2s, RMSEs, coefficient
d estimates and their estimated standard errors for each period.
d Graphs are also optionally provided, juxtaposing the rolling

d 'BGTEST': module to calculate Breusch-Godfrey test for serial correlation
d 
d bgtest computes the Breusch (1978)-Godfrey (1978) Lagrange
d multiplier test for nonindependence in the error distribution.
d For a specified number of lags  p, the test's null of independent
d errors has alternatives of either AR(p) or MA(p). The test
d statistic, a T R^2 measure, is distributed Chi-squared(p) under
d the null hypothesis. The test is asymptotically equivalent to the
d Box- Pierce portmanteau test, or Q statistic (wntestq), for p
d lags, but unlike  the Q statistic, the Breusch-Godfrey test is
d valid in the presence of  stochastic regressors such as lagged
d values of the dependent variable.  For p=1, the test is
d asymptotically equivalent to the Durbin-Watson 'h'  statistic
d (durbinh), which may be considered a special case of the
d Breusch-Godfrey test statistic. This is version 1.03 of the
d software, updated from that published in STB-55 to zero-fill
d lagged residuals, altering the  degrees of freedom in the
d auxiliary regression. The force option has been added to allow
d bgtest to be employed after regress, robust and newey. The test
d is built in to  Stata 7 as "bgodfrey"; also see "bgodfrey2" which
d will work on a single timeseries of a panel.

d 'IVVIF': module to report variance inflation factors after IV
d 
d ivvif extends Stata's official vif/estat vif command, which
d reports variance inflation factors. It differs in two ways. As
d well as working after  regress, it can run after instrumented
d regressions done with  ivreg or  ivreg2. In this case, it
d projects regressors onto instruments before computing VIFs. In
d other words, it reports the VIFs for the second stage of
d two-stage least squares. The other difference is that it makes
d the results available in a return matrix, named "vif", along with
d vif's return macros, which can ease working with the results in
d Stata code.

d 'VECECM': module to estimate vector error correction models (ECMs)
d 
d  vececm estimates a vector error correction model (ECM) after one
d or more cointegrating vectors have been identified using
d Johansen's maximum-likelihood cointegration rank test (see help
d johans). vececm uses the estimates of the cointegrating vectors
d as calculated by johans (the beta' matrix) to compute the value
d of each vector. Each vector then appears in the system estimates
d constrained by the value of its corresponding weight (given by
d the alpha matrix) in each equation. vececm doesn't allow a
d varlist as it simply uses the one specified at johans. This
d package contains wntstmvq, omninorm, and johans, all of which are
d required by vececm.

d biplot draws biplots of the data matrix defined by varlist.
d Biplots are  useful for visual inspection of data matrices,

d outliers. In a biplot variables (columns) are shown  as arrows
d from the origin and observations (rows) are shown as points. The
d configuration of arrows reflects the relations of the variables.
d The cosine of the angle between the arrows reflects the
d correlation between the variables they represent. If the
d variables are not standardized, the length of each arrow reflects
d the standard deviation of the variable it represents. The scatter
d of observations shows relations among observations. The distance
d between two points approximates the Euclidean distance between
d two observations of the data matrix. The cutpoint of a
d perpendicular from a point to an arrow shows the value of the
d variable the arrow represents.

d suppress some output; and  3) it will not stop if there is a
d differing number of observations in the two  files.  Generally,
d the id variable values should be unique within each file.  If the
d id values are not unique then proper matching may not occur; cf3
d will warn the user but will continue.  Incorrectly-matched
d observations, where the  variables being compared also differ,

d 
d perturb is a tool for assessing the impact of small random

d is an alternative for collinearity diagnostics such as vif,
d collin, coldiag, coldiag2. perturb is particularly useful for
d evaluating collinearity if interactions are present or nonlinear
d transformations of variables, e.g. a squared term. peturb can
d show how the perturbations affect the estimates of a variable and
d terms derived from it whereas other collinearity diagnostics
d simply treat interactions and transformations as regular
d independent variables. perturb is not limited to linear
d regression but can be used for all regression-like models.
d perturb can also deal with categorical variables by randomly
d misclassifying them to assess the impact on parameter estimates.

d estimation (CUE); LIML and k-class estimation; automatic output
d of the Hansen-Sargan or Anderson-Rubin statistic for
d overidentifying restrictions; C statistic test of exogeneity of
d subsets of instruments (orthog() option); kernel-based
d autocorrelation-consistent (AC) and heteroskedastic and
d autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) estimation, with user-specified
d choice of kernel; Cragg's "heteroskedastic OLS" (HOLS) estimator;
d default reporting of large-sample statistics (z and chi-squared
d rather than t and F); small option to report small-sample
d statistics; first-stage regression reported with F-test of
d excluded instruments and R-squared with included instruments
d "partialled-out"; enhanced Cragg-Donald tests for weak
d instruments, redundancy of instruments,  significance of
d endogenous regressors. ivreg28 can also be used for ordinary
d least squares (OLS) estimation using the same command syntax as
d Stata's official regress and newey. ivreg28 is the last version

d 'IVACTEST': module to perform Cumby-Huizinga test for autocorrelation after IV/OLS estimation
d 
d ivactest performs the general specification test of serial
d correlation proposed by Cumby and Huizinga (1992) after OLS or
d instrumental variables (IV) estimation. In their words, the null
d hypothesis of the test is that the regression error is a  moving
d average of known order q>=0 against the general alternative that
d autocorrelations of the regression error are nonzero at lags
d greater than q. The test is general enough to test the hypothesis
d that the regression error has no serial correlation (q=0) or the
d null hypothesis that serial correlation in  the regression error
d exists, but dies out at a known finite lag (q>0). The test is
d especially attractive because it can be used in frequently
d encountered cases where alternative such as the Box-Pierce test
d (wntestq), Durbin's h test (estat durbinalt) and the
d Breusch-Godfrey test (estat bgodfrey) are not applicable.

d 'CMP': module to implement conditional (recursive) mixed process estimator
d 
d cmp estimates multi-equation, conditional recursive mixed process
d   models. "Mixed process" means that different equations can have
d different kinds of dependent variables. The choices are:
d continuous (like OLS), tobit (left-, right-, or bi-censored), and
d probit. A dependent variable in one equation can  appear on the
d right side of another equation. "Conditional" means, however,
d that cmp can only fit "recursive" models with clearly defined
d stages,  not ones with simultaneous causation. {A and B can be
d determinants of C and C a determinant of D--but D cannot be a
d determinant of A, B, or C. And the  "conditional" means that the
d model can vary by observation. An equation can be dropped for
d observations for which it is not relevant--if, say, a worker
d retraining program is not offered in a city then the determinants
d of uptake cannot be modeled there. Or the type of dependent
d variable can vary by observation, though the utility of this
d freedom is less obvious. cmp's modeling framework therefore
d embraces those of the official Stata commands probit, ivprobit,
d biprobit, tobit, and ivtobit, in principle even regress, sureg,
d ivreg, as well as the user-written triprobit, mvprobit, bitobit,
d and and mvtobit. It goes beyond them in offering far more
d flexibility in model construction. To take one arbitrary example,
d one could  regress a continuous variable, on two endogenous
d variables, one binary and the other sometimes left-censored,
d instrumenting each with additional variables. And it allows the
d models to vary by observation. In some cases, the gain is
d consistent estimation where it was difficult before. In other
d cases, the gain is just in efficiency. For example if y is
d continuous, x is a sometimes-left-censored determinant of y, and
d z is an instrument, then the effect of x on y can be consistently
d estimated with 2SLS (Kelejian 1971). However, a cmp estimate that
d uses the information that x is censored will be efficient, based
d as it is on a more accurate model. The routine runs faster under
d Stata 10, but will run under Stata 9.2 as well.

d 'GOLOGIT2': module to estimate generalized logistic regression models for ordinal dependent variables
d 
d gologit2 estimates generalized ordered logit models for ordinal
d dependent variables. A major strength of gologit2 is that it can
d also estimate three special cases of the generalized model: the
d proportional odds/parallel lines model, the partial proportional
d odds model, and the logistic regression model. Hence, gologit2
d can estimate models that are less restrictive than the
d proportional odds /parallel lines models estimated by ologit
d (whose assumptions are often violated) but more parsimonious and
d interpretable than those estimated by a non-ordinal method, such
d as multinomial logistic regression (i.e. mlogit). Other key
d strengths of gologit2 include options for linear constraints,
d alternative model parameterizations, automated model fitting,
d survey data (svy) estimation, alternative link functions (logit,
d probit, complementary log-log, log-log & cauchit), and the
d computation of estimated probabilities via the predict command.
d gologit2 works under both Stata 8.2 and Stata 9 or higher. Syntax
d is the same for both versions; but if you are using Stata 9 or
d higher, gologit2 supports several prefix commands, including by,
d nestreg, xi and sw. gologit2 is inspired by Vincent Fu's gologit
d program and is backward compatible with it but offers several
d additional powerful options. Also see Stata Journal, 6(1), 58-82. d

d 'GROUPCL': module to estimate grouped conditional logit models
d 
d  In many applications of conditional logit models the choice set
d and  the characteristics of that set are identical for groups
d of decision makers.  In that case it is possible to obtain a more
d computationally efficient estimation of the model by grouping
d the data and employing "multin". The command "multin"  is
d designed for estimation of grouped conditional logit models. It
d produces the same output as "clogit" but requires a more compact
d data layout. This is particularly relevant when the model
d comprises many observations and/or choices.  In this situation it
d is possible to obtain substantial reductions in the size of  the
d data set and the time required for estimation. The command
d "groupdata"  converts the data as required by "clogit" to the new
d format required by "multin". The command "dirmul" performs
d Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) regression which is a  parametric
d alternative to deal with overdispersion in the context of the
d grouped conditional logit model. The "dirmul" command can also be
d used to  estimate Beta-Binomial regression models.

d 'NHARVEY': module to perform Nyblom-Harvey panel test of common stochastic trends
d 
d nharvey estimates one form of the test of common stochastic
d trends developed by  Nyblom and Harvey (NH, 2000). The test is of
d the validity of a specified value of the rank of the covariance
d matrix of the disturbances driving the multivariate random walk.
d This rank is equal to the number of common trends, or levels, in
d the series. As NH show, "this test is very simple insofar as it
d does not require any models to be estimated, even if serial
d correlation is present." (p.176) The special case calculated by
d nharvey is that of the rank (K in NH' terms) equalling zero,
d which may be taken as a test that there are no common trends
d among the variables. NH state that "common trends imply
d cointegration, and vice versa." Thus a failure to reject the null
d hypothesis of zero common trends is also an indication that the
d variables do not form a cointegrated combination.  The test may
d be considered as a generalization of the Nyblom and Makelainen
d (1983) and Kwiatkowski et al. (1992, kpss) univariate tests for
d stationarity of a series.  Those tests are of the null hypothesis
d that the series is stationary, or stationary around a
d deterministic trend, against the alternative that a random walk
d component is present. nharvey considers the same structure in the
d context of multiple time series.

d 'LDECOMP': module decomposing the total effects in a logistic regression into direct and indirect effects
d 
d ldecomp decomposes the total effects of a categorical variable in
d logistic regresion into direct and indirect effects using a
d method method by Erikson et al. (2005) and a generalization of
d this method by Buis (2008). Consider an example where social
d class has an indirect effect on attending college through
d academic performance in high school. The indirect effect is
d obtained by comparing the proportion of lower class students that
d attend college with the counterfactual proportion of lower class
d students if they had the distribution of performance of the
d higher class students. This captures the association between
d class and attending college due to differences in performance.
d The direct effect of class is obtained by comparing the
d proportion of higher class students with the counterfactual
d proportion of lower class students if they had the same
d distribution of performance as the higher class students. This
d way the variable performance is kept constant. If these
d comparisons are carried out in the form of log odds ratios than
d the total effect will equal the sum of the direct and indirect
d effects. In its original form this method assumes that the
d variable through which the indirect effect occurs is normally
d distributed. This is generalized by Buis (2008) by allowing this
d variable to have any distribution, which has the added advantage
d of simplifying the method.

d variable is missing. The dependent variable is regressed on the
d missing flag for each  independent variable. The statistical
d significance of the slope is reported as an indicator of whether
d the dependent variable is  statistically different where an
d independent variable is missing. Another test compares the null
d model to the model with the missing flag and performs a BIC
d difference test, again as an indication of  whether the dependent
d variable is statistically different when an  independent variable
d is missing. If the model was specified with robust standard
d errors, then robust standard errors are used to perform the
d hypothesis test related to  the slope for the missing value flag. d

d into 'C', then this chain consists of two events, the first one
d being the change of 'A' into 'B' and the second one being the
d change of 'B' into 'C'. These changes are mapped and the end
d value of the chain is added as a new variable to each event in
d the chain (so the line "A B" in your database would become "A B
d C" and the line "B C" would become "B C C"). -mapch- also
d tabulates the frequency of n-step chains with n<1<=N (N=total
d number of events in your database). Mapping chains in a database
d of several tens of thousands of events can be done in as little
d as a couple of seconds.

d ivendog computes a test for endogeneity in a regression estimated
d via instrumental variables (IV), the null hypothesis for which
d states that an   ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the
d same equation would yield    consistent estimates: that is, any
d endogeneity among the regressors    would not have deleterious
d effects on OLS estimates. A rejection of the null    indicates
d that endogenous regressors' effects on the estimates are
d meaningful,  and instrumental variables techniques are
d required. The test was    first proposed by Durbin (1954) and
d separately by Wu (1973) (his T4    statistic) and Hausman (1978).
d This "Durbin-Wu-Hausman" (DWH) test is numerically equivalent
d to the standard "Hausman test" obtained using {help hausman} with
d the  sigmamore option, in which both forms of the model must be
d estimated. Under the null, it is    distributed Chi-squared with
d m degrees of freedom, where m is the number of    regressors
d specified as endogenous in the original instrumental variables
d regression. The ivendog output also contains another test
d statistic: the "Wu-Hausman" T2 statistic of Wu (1973). This
d routine is a replacement for "dmexog". W Its  facilities are
d also available in our "ivreg2" routine via the "orthog" option.

d 'IVRESET': module to perform Ramsey/Pesaran-Taylor/Pagan-Hall RESET specification test after IV/GMM/OLS estimation

d  ivreset performs various flavors of Ramsey's regression error
d specification test (RESET) as adapted by Pesaran and Taylor
d (1999) and Pagan and Hall (1983) for instrumental variables (IV)
d estimation. The RESET test is sometimes called an "omitted
d variables test" but probably is best interpreted as a test of
d neglected nonlinearities in the choice of functional form. Under
d the null that there are no neglected nonlinearities, the
d residuals should be uncorrelated with low-order polynomials in
d y-hat, where the y-hats are the "forecast values" of the
d dependent variable that are functions of the instruments
d (exogenous variables) only. The test flavors vary according to
d the polynomial terms (square, cube, 4th power of y-hat), the
d choice of forecast values (Pesaran-Taylor optimal forecasts or
d Pagan-Hall reduced form forecasts), test statistic (Wald or
d GMM-distance), and large vs. small sample statistic (chi-squared
d or F-statistic). If the original estimation was
d heteroskedastic-robust, cluster-robust,
d autocorrelation-consistent (AC), or heteroskedastic and
d autocorrelation-consistent (HAC), the RESET test reported will be
d as well. ivreset can also be used after OLS or HOLS regression
d with regress or ivreg2, when there are no endogenous regressors.

d 'HCAVAR': module to perform Hierarchical Clusters Analysis of variables
d 
d hcavar realizes a Hierarchical Clusters Analysis on variables.
d The variables can be numerous, ordinal or binary. The distances
d (dissimilarity measures for binary variables) between two
d variables are computed as the squared root of 2 times one minus
d the Pearson correlation. For binary variables, it is possible to
d use other similarity coefficients as Matching, Jaccard, Russel or
d Dice (See measure option for more details). The distance matrix
d is computed as  the squared root of one minus the value of these
d coefficients. In the field of Item Response Theory, it is
d possible to define conditional measures  to the score as defined
d by Roussos, Stout and Marden (1998): conditional correlations,
d conditional covariance, or Mantel-Haenszel measures of
d similarity. In the same field, it is possible to compute, for a
d set of obtained partition of the items, the DETECT, Iss and R
d indexes defined by Zhang and Stout (1999). This routine replaces
d hcaccprox.

d 
d rbounds calculates Rosenbaum bounds for average treatment effects

d (hidden bias)  between treatment and control cases. rbounds takes
d the difference in the  response variable between treatment and
d control cases as input variable  varname. The procedure then
d calculates Wilcoxon signrank tests that give upper and lower
d bound estimates of significance levels at given levels of  hidden
d bias. Under the assumption of additive treatment effects, rbounds
d  also provides Hodges-Lehmann point estimates and confidence
d intervals for  the average treatment effect on the treated. If
d installed, the input variable  varname may be generated from
d psmatch or psmatch2. Currently,  rbounds implements the
d sensitivity tests for matched (1x1) pairs only.

d 'HOTDECK': module to impute missing values using the hotdeck method
d 
d hotdeck replaces missing values for the variable indicated by its
d argument.  It should be used within a multiple imputation
d sequence since missing values  are imputed stochastically rather
d than deterministically. The nmiss missing  values in each stratum
d of the data described by the `by' option are replaced  by values
d sampled from the nobs observed values in the same stratum. The
d approximate Bayesian bootstrap method of Rubin and Scheker is
d used; first a  bootstrap sample of nobs observations is sampled
d with replacement from the  observed values, and the nmiss missing
d values are sampled at random (again with replacement) from this
d bootstrap sample. If a file is specified in a using clause, the
d modified file is written to disk and the existing  data in memory
d are unchanged. Otherwise the data in memory are modified. This is
d version 1.65 of the software, requiring Stata v9. hotdeck6 may be
d used in earlier versions of Stata.

d sencode: Encode a string variable non-alphanumerically into a numeric variable
d sencode is an extended version of encode. It takes, as input, a string
d variable, and generates, as output, a numeric variable, with value labels
d corresponding to values of the string variable. The output numeric variable
d may replace the input string variable or be generated as a new variable.
d sencode orders the numeric values corresponding to string values in the
d sequential order of appearance in the input string variable in the data set,
d or in another order specified by the user, instead of ordering them in
d alphanumeric order of the string value, as encode does. The mapping from
d numeric code values to string labels may be one-to-one (coded in order of
d first appearance of the string value) or many-to-one (coded in each
d observation by the position of that observation in the data set, or in the
d user-specified ordering).

d handle frequency weight, the group sizes can essentially be
d treated as frequency     weights. The program also can use
d standard error of group means of the     health outcome if
d supplied.  If not, it will be estimated as the      standard

d 'SURFACE': module to draw a 3D wireform surface plot
d 
d  The surface command attempts to draw a wireframe plot from three
d variables.  var1 specifies the x-coordinate, var2 the
d y-coordinate and var3 the  z-coordinate. Alternatively the
d function can draw a circle at each  point and add a straight line
d going down to the lowest point.  This function can handle data
d that is not in the form of a matrix of values.  However if there
d are too many x- and y- values the function will attempt  to round
d the dataset values into a more reasonable spread of values. This
d will result in very messy figures. However in such a case it is
d the  impression that is needed. Many other statistical packages
d require a full  matrix of values. This is not a problem for the
d nowire option.  At present the state of rotating the diagram is
d limited to interchanging the axes. This is an update of the
d routine published in STB 51 (gr39). Users of Stata 10 may use
d surface; for earlier versions of Stata, use surface7.

d 
d Clarify is a program that uses Monte Carlo simulation to convert the

d interest to researchers.  The program, designed for use with the Stata
d statistics package, can help researchers in three ways.
d 
d (1) It can extract new quantities of interest from standard statistical
d models, thereby enriching the substance of social science research.
d (2) It can assess the uncertainty surrounding any quantity of interest,
d so it should improve the candor and realism of statistical discourse.
d (3) It can convert raw parameter estimates into results that anyone,
d regardless of statistical training, can understand. Thus, it should be
d useful to those who want to convey their results to a broader audience.

d odds ratio no longer approximates the risk ratio. As the

d 
d seqlogit fits a sequential logit model. This model estimates the
d effect of the explanatory variables on the probabilities of
d passing a set of transitions. For example, given a highest
d achieved level of education the researcher studies the effect of
d socio-economic status on the probabilities of passing the
d different transitions between levels of education. The user can
d specify any decision tree as long as each level of the dependent
d variable (e.g. level of education) can be reached through one and
d only one sequence of transitions. If these levels have values
d (e.g. years of education) than this model also implies an effect
d of the explanatory variable on the highest achieved level. The
d program seqlogitdecomp, which is part of the seqlogit package,
d displays a graph that decomposes this effect on the highest
d achieved level into parts that measure the effect on the
d probabilities of passing the transitions and the importance of
d each transition.

d have values between 0 and some maximum value (default 1) and the
d sum of the three variables should be equal to that maximum
d (within rounding error). Most commonly, three fractions or
d proportions add to 1, or three percents add to 100. The
d constraint that the three variables have a constant sum means
d that there are just two independent pieces of information. Hence
d it is possible to plot observations in two dimensions. Triangular

d ingap: Insert gap observations in a dataset
d ingap inserts gap observations into a list of positions in an existing data

d gap observations, unless the user specifies otherwise.  Often, the user
d specifies non-missing values in the gap observations for one particular
d existing string variable, known as the row label variable. This row label
d variable may then be output with a list of other variables to form a
d publication-ready table with labelled gap rows, using the listtex package.
d Alternatively, the row label variable may be encoded, using the sencode
d package, to form a numeric variable with value labels. This numeric variable
d can then be plotted on one axis of a graph to define axis labels, including
d gap axis labels.  The sencode and listtex packages are downloadable from SSC

d 'SHEAFCOEF': module to compute sheaf coefficients
d 
d sheafcoef is a post-estimation command that estimates sheaf
d coefficients (Heise, Sociological Methods and Research 1972). A
d sheaf coefficient assumes that a block of variables influence the
d dependent variable through a latent variable. This assumption is
d not tested, nor is it testable; a sheaf coefficient is just a
d different way of presenting the results from a model. Its main
d usefulness is in comparing the relative strength of the influence
d of several blocks of variables. For example, say we want to know
d what determines the probability of working non-standard hours
d (evenings, nights, and weekends) and we have a block of variables
d representing characteristics of the job and another block of
d variables representing the family situation of the respondent,
d and we want to say something about the relative importance of job
d characteristics versus family situation. In that case one could
d estimate a logit model with both blocks of variables and
d optionally some other control variables. After that one can use
d sheafcoef to display the effects of two latent variables, family
d background and job characteristics, which are both standardized
d to have a standard deviation of 1, and can thus be more easily
d compared.

d  vtokenize and vgettoken do for variables what tokenize and
d gettoken do for strings in Stata. The main use of this is for
d dealing  with nasty datasets. vtokenize splits every observation
d into its tokens, creating as many  variables as needed to hold
d the tokens. vgettoken pulls the first token off every observation
d of a variable,  placing the result in a variable of the user's
d choice, optionally placing  the remainder into yet another

d 'IPSHIN': module to perform Im-Pesaran-Shin panel unit root test
d 
d ipshin estimates the t-test for unit roots in heterogeneous
d panels developed by Im, Pesaran and Shin (IPS, 1997).  It allows
d for individual effects, time trends, and common time effects.
d Based on the mean of the individual Dickey-Fuller t-statistics
d of each unit in the panel, the IPS test  assumes that all series
d are non-stationary under the null hypothesis. Lags of the
d dependent variable may be introduced to allow for serial
d correlation in  the errors.  The exact critical values of the
d t-bar statistic are given in IPS. After transformation by factors
d provided in the paper (available for no more than 8 lags on any
d series), the Psi[t-bar] statistic is distributed standard normal
d under the null hypothesis of nonstationarity.

d no-extra-location codes must all be in the variables with the higher numbers
d (for example, the first three extra latitudes and longitudes may be valid
d locations and the following four may be no-extra-location codes, but it is not
d okay for extra variables 1, 3, and 6 only to be no-extra-location codes).
d The no-extra-location code is the number 999, or a missing data code.  This

d stage1( <first stage model>) where  <depvar> is the name of the

d <ins. variables> is the list of instruments for the endog rhs
d vars, and  <first stage model> is either 'probit', 'linear', or
d empty.  If empty or 'linear', the first stage equations are run
d as OLS.  If probit, they are (all) run as probits. The programs

d 'MFX2': module to enhance mfx command for obtaining marginal effects or elasticities after estimation
d 
d mfx2 obtains marginal effects or elasticities after estimation.
d It is probably most useful after multiple-outcome commands like
d ologit, oprobit, gologit2, slogit, mlogit, oglm, and mprobit, but
d it works with other commands as well. mfx2 offers two key
d enhancements to Stata's mfx compute command: (a) after multiple-
d outcome commands mfx2 automates the calling of mfx and saves the
d marginal effects for all outcomes in a single matrix; and (b)
d marginal effects are stored in a way that makes them easy to use
d with post-estimation table formatting commands like outreg2 and
d estout. mfx2 is inspired, in part, by Tamas Bartus's margeff
d command. margeff is often quicker than mfx2 and offers powerful
d additional options but mfx2 works with a wider range of commands.
d Presumably/hopefully, mfx2 will work whenever mfx will work (and
d will not work whenever mfx doesn't), but not all possible
d commands have been tested.  In order to fully understand mfx2 you
d should also understand mfx; see help mfx.

d Program by Alexis Dinno.

d Version: 1.4.3 (updated September 12, 2011)
d Distribution-Date: 12sep2011
d 
d This package contains the program {cmd:paran} which performs Horn's parallel
d analysis of component/factors.
d 
d NOTE: Development is ongoing, and feedback is always welcome. This version of
d {cmd:paran} involves significant improvements and changes. The program is stable
d and very much past the beta stage. The current version requires STATA 8 or
d higher. I am happy to provide versions compatible with older STATA on request.
d 
d {cmd:HISTORY}
d 
d 12sep2011 (1.4.3)  clarified color coding of output in the documentation,
d                    and corrected the description of the default behavior
d                    when the factor() option is used but left blank.
d 
d 04jan2010 (1.4.2)  corrected a bug which would incorrecly display factors
d                    with eigenvalues greater than one instead of zero, when
d                    paran was used with factor() but without the all option.
d 
d 28dec2009 (1.4.1)  corrected a bug preventing the use of aweights and
d                    fweights.
d 
d 14oct2008 (1.4.0)  many improvements to documentation, improved graph
d                    options, improved output, added a seed() option,
d                    refined application for common factor analysis. added a
d                    simulated data set with 4 true components to follow the
d                    example in the Stata Journal article.
d 
d 30apr2008 (1.3.5)  fixed a bug in output formatting that could sometimes
d                    occur when using the factor option.
d 
d 28mar2008 (1.3.4)  one minor improvement to graph output
d 
d 14mar2008 (1.3.3)  minor improvements to graph output
d 
d 4mar2008  (1.3.2)  added an option to draw graphs along the lines of those
d                    produced in Horn's 1965 paper.
d 
d 1mar2008  (1.3.1)  improved status reporting and fixed a bug where the values
d                    for the point estimates of the eigenvalues of the random
d                    data sets were incorrectly reported in the estimated bias
d                    column. this was a reporting bug only, and paran correctly
d                    reported the number of components or factors meeting the
d                    criertion.
d 
d                    incorrectly reported.
d 6sep2007  (1.2.6)  removed the options for conducting parallel analysis as per
d                    the recommendations by Hayton et al., and documented the
d                    reasons for this.
d 
d 16aug2007 (1.2.5)  added two output options and fixed a serious bug that
d                    deflated estimated bias as iterations increased.
d 
d 9aug2007  (1.2.4)  added two options to perform parallel analysis in line
d                    with the data generation scheme of Hayton, et al., 2004.
d 
d 3aug2007  (1.2.3)   corrected a serious bug introduced in the previous
d                    release that halted output.
d 
d 24jan2007 (1.2.2)  revised output to display components for which the
d                    unadjusted eigenvalues are greater than one, but for
d                    which the adjusted eigenvalues are less than one.
d 
d 13nov2004 (1.2.1)  revised estimates selection to user-specified centile.

d 'R2O': module to calculate an ordinal explained variation statistic
d 
d r2o calculates the ordinal explained variation  statistic (i.e.,
d R-squared) described by Lacy (2006), which is used to summarize
d the fit of a regression model for an ordinal response. It  rests
d on an ordinal variation measure that entails no assumptions
d about intercategory  distances or distributional form.  This
d measure is valid regardless of the method used to estimate the
d model, and was  shown to outperform various pseudo-R-squared
d measures in  estimating the value of the true R-squared for a
d regression model for an underlying continuous  response, even
d though its sense does not require  such. -r2o- is to be used
d after a relevant  categorical response model has been run, while
d the e() list is still intact. By default, the  program recognizes
d the following as relevant response models: -ologit-, -oprobit-,
d -mlogit-, and  -gologit2-.  However, -r2o-  should work after
d any estimation command for which predict- p1,..., pk will
d calculate predicted  probabilities, and which follows official
d Stata's  conventions for naming items in the e() list.

d 
d gnbstrat fits a maximum-likelihood generalized negative binomial
d with endogenous stratification regression model of depvar on
d indepvars, where depvar is a nonnegative count variable > 0.
d lnalpha is parameterized by the predictors entered within its
d parentheses. gnbstrat simultaneously accommodates three features
d of on-site samples dealing with count  data: overdispersion
d relative to the Poisson; truncation at zero, and endogenous
d stratification  due to oversampling of frequent users of the
d site. Endogenous stratification occurs when the  likelihood of
d sampling observations is dependent on a choice made by the
d subject of study which  is in itself the dependent variable. For
d example, in recreational demand analysis, if an on-site  survey
d is conducted, one is more likely to interview subjects who visit
d the site more times per  week and ask how many times they visit,
d hence the endogeneity. Also patients who visit the doctor  more
d frequently are also more likely to be sampled if the survey is
d conducted at the clinic, etc.

d 'CEM': module to perform Coarsened Exact Matching
d 
d  The cem package provides a Stata implementation of coarsened
d exact matching, a new method for improving the estimation of
d causal effects by reducing  imbalance in covariates between
d treated and control groups.  Coarsened exact matching is faster,
d is easier to use and understand,  requires fewer assumptions, is
d more easily automated, and possesses more  attractive statistical
d properties for many applications than do existing  matching
d methods. In coarsened exact matching, users temporarily coarsen
d their  data, exact match on these coarsened data, and then run
d their analysis on  the uncoarsened, matched data. Coarsened exact
d matching bounds the degree  of model dependence and causal effect
d estimation error by ex ante user choice,  is monotonic imbalance
d bounding (so that reducing the maximum imbalance on  one variable
d has no effect on others), does not require a separate procedure
d to restrict data to common support, meets the congruence
d principle,  is approximately invariant to measurement error,
d balances all nonlinearities and  interactions in sample (i.e.,
d not merely in expectation), and works with  multiply imputed
d datasets. Other matching methods inherit many of the coarsened
d exact matching method's properties when applied to further match
d data preprocessed by coarsened exact matching.

d effect ("matchef") are created. See options disk and force for

d sets, where constraints on memory and matsize make standard
d estimation difficult and time consuming.    Instead of solving
d (X'X)b=X'y by inverting X'X it solves the system by computing the

d is an extension to the Stata egen command. It can be used with
d egen to  create a new variable containing the digits at a certain
d decimal place of an  existing variable. Options are available to
d specify the decimal position that  you wish to examine as well as
d the rounding that should be applied to the variable  when
d extracting this digit. The resulting variable can be tabulated
d and used in  goodness-of-fit tests as required. This is useful
d for in-depth exploration of digit preferences. digituse
d cross-tabulates digits against all the decimal places available
d in a variable,  reporting results as percentage distribution of
d digits at each decimal place.  This is useful for initial visual
d inspection of digit preferences. zerouse can be used to examine
d the pattern of use of the 'zero' digit within a variable.  The
d range of decimal places examined can be defined as can the 'zero'
d digit.   Results can be tabulated against other variables or
d stored in a new variable for later use.

d be heteroskedastic and non-normally  distributed. The test is
d carried out by taking a Box-Cox transformation of the dependent

d lambda=1. A rejection of the null suggests that the Tobit
d specification is unsuitable, as an alternative value for lambda
d would be required to return the linearity, homoskedasticity and
d normality assumptions that are necessary for consistent
d estimation.  Critical values are obtained via the parametric
d bootstrap, where the regressors are assumed to be stochastic.

d 'MLOGITROC': module to calculate multiclass ROC Curves and AUC from Multinomial Logistic Regression
d

d accuracy based on multinomial logistic regression using mlogit.
d The algorithm begins by running mlogit B=100 times using
d bootstrapped records for each run while the original class labels
d are intact.  Class prediction is then performed for records not
d sampled during bootstrapping, and accuracy for the left out
d records is determined as the fraction of correct class membership
d predictions. This results in B=100 realizations of the accuracy
d for the alternative distribution.  Next, B=100 mlogit runs are
d made again, but this time after shuffling class labels of all
d records prior to modeling, which results in B=100 realizations of
d null accuracy.  Smoothed probability distributions are obtained
d for the B=100 alternative and null accuracy values using kernel
d density estimation (KDE, Gaussian kernel) to obtain 100 smoothed
d realizations for alternative and null accuracy.  The false
d positive rate (FPR), true positive rate (TPR), and area under the
d curve (AUC) are determined from the smooth pdfs derived from KDE.
d  Twoway scatter plots of the smoothed pdfs are constructed,

d calculates the BIC  statistic. It then calculates the probability

d 'ABAR': module to perform Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation
d 
d   abar performs the Arellano-Bond (1991) test for
d autocorrelation. The test was originally proposed for a
d particular linear Generalized Method of Moments  dynamic panel
d data estimator, but is quite general in its applicability--more
d general  than dwstat, durbina, bgodfrey, and xtserial. It can be
d applied to linear GMM regressions in general, and thus to
d ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least-squares (2SLS)
d regressions, which can be seen as special cases of linear GMM. It
d is appropriate for both time-series and cross-section time-series
d (panel) regressions. It can also be made consistent in the
d presence of various patterns of error covariance. Specifically,
d abar will run after regress, ivreg, ivreg2, and ivreg2, gmm in
d their "plain"  (homoskedastic), robust, and cluster variants. It
d will also run after newey and newey2. In the context of an
d Arellano-Bond GMM regression, which is run on first differences,
d AR(1) is to be expected, and therefore the Arellano-Bond AR(1)
d test result is usually ignored in that context. The AR(2) test on
d the residuals in first differences is used to detect AR(1) in the
d underlying levels variables. But in other contexts, such as
d simple OLS in levels, the AR(1) test is relevant. abar is not
d appropriate for fixed-effects regressions for dynamic models,
d assuming those are done via a mean-deviation transformation. This
d is because the Arellano-Bond AR() test assumes that
d right-hand-side variables are not "post-determined," i.e., not
d correlated with future errors. In a dynamic setting, future
d values of regressors can depend on future errors. And after the
d mean-deviations transformation, future values of the original
d regressors affect  current values of the transformed versions.

d 'RANKTEST': module to test the rank of a matrix using the Kleibergen-Paap rk statistic
d 
d  ranktest implements the Kleibergen-Paap (2006) rk test for the
d rank of a matrix.  Tests of the rank of a matrix have many
d practical applications.  For example, in econometrics the
d requirement for identification is the rank condition, which
d states that a particular matrix must be of full column rank.
d Another example from econometrics concerns cointegration in
d vector autoregressive (VAR) models; the Johansen trace test is a
d test of a rank of a particular matrix.  The traditional test of
d the rank of a matrix for the standard (stationary) case is the
d Anderson (1951) canonical correlations test. If we denote one
d list of variables as Y and a second as Z, and we calculate the
d squared canonical correlations between Y and Z, the LM form of
d the Anderson test, where the null hypothesis is that the matrix
d of correlations or regression parameters B between Y and Z has
d rank(B)=r, is N times the sum of the r+1 largest squared
d canonical correlations.  A large test statistic and rejection of
d the null indicates that the matrix has rank at least r+1.  The
d Cragg-Donald (1993) statistic is a closely related Wald test for
d the rank of a matrix.  Both the Anderson and Cragg-Donald tests
d require the assumption that the covariance matrix has a Kronecker
d form; when this is not so, e.g., when disturbances are
d heteroskedastic or autocorrelated, the test statistics are no
d longer valid. The Kleibergen-Paap (2006) rk statistic is a
d generalization of the Anderson canonical correlation rank test to
d the case of a non-Kronecker covariance matrix.  The
d implementation in ranktest will calculate rk statistics that are
d robust to various forms of heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation,
d and clustering.

d If there is a threshold, the command finds it by using the

d augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
d fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
d (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
d that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
d period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
d condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
d first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
d own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
d other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
d conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
d differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
d the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
d often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
d variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
d (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
d added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
d brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
d predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
d instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
d Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
d for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
d Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
d called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
d Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
d their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
d estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
d variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
d two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
d downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
d  To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
d finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
d derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
d   efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
d Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
d the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10
d (25feb2008 update) or later can take advantage of speed
d improvements due to Mata.

d sfpanel.  Stochastic frontier models for panel data (version 1.3  31jan2013).
d 
d 
d {cmd:sfpanel} fits parametric Stochastic production or cost Frontier (SF) models for
d panel data. When estimation is done with likelihood-based methods, the SF model is:
d 
d   y_it = alpha + beta*X_it + v_it {c 177} u
d 
d where v_it is a normally distributed error term and u is a one-sided strictly
d non-negative term representing inefficiency. The sign of the u term is positive or
d negative depending on whether the frontier describes a cost or production function,
d respectively.
d 
d Among the time-varying inefficiency models (u=u_it), {cmd:sfpanel} fits:
d 
d {cmd:i)} the true fixed-effects (TFE) and the true random-effects (TRE) models
d  developed by Greene (2005), in which both time-invariant unmeasured heterogeneity
d  (alpha=alpha_i) and time-varying firm inefficiency are considered;
d 
d {cmd:ii)} the Battese and Coelli (1995) model, in which the u_it is obtained by
d  truncation at zero of the normal distribution with mean (Z_it*delta), where Z_it is
d  a set of covariates explaining the mean of inefficiency;
d 
d {cmd:iii)} the time decay model by Battese and Coelli (1992), in which u_it=u_i*B(t),
d  and B(t)=[exp(-eta*(t-T_i))]. u_i is assumed to be truncated-normally distributed
d  with non-zero mean and constant variance, while eta governs the temporal pattern
d  of inefficiency;
d 
d {cmd:iv)} the flexible parametric model by Kumbhakar (1990), in which u_it=u_i*B(t),
d  and B(t)=[1+exp(bt+ct^2)]^(-1).
d 
d Among the time-invariant inefficiency models (u=u_i), {cmd:sfpanel} fits:
d 
d {cmd:v)} the Battese and Coelli (1988) model, in which u_i is truncated-normally
d distributed with non-zero mean and constant variance;
d 
d {cmd:vi)} the Pitt and Lee (1981) model, in which u_i is half-normally distributed with
d  constant variance.
d 
d When estimation is done with least squares methods, the SF production model is:
d 
d   y_it = alpha + beta*X_it + v_it
d 
d Among the time-varying inefficiency models (alpha=alpha_it), {cmd:sfpanel} fits:
d 
d {cmd:vii)} the Lee and Schmidt (1993) model, in which alpha_it = theta_t*delta_i and
d  theta_t are parameters to be estimated. This model is a special case of Kumbhakar (1990),
d  in which B(t) is represented by a set of dummy variables for time;
d 
d {cmd:viii)} the Cornwell et al. (1990) model, in which alpha_it = delta_i0 + delta_i1*t + delta_i2*t^2.
d 
d Among the time-invariant inefficiency models (alpha=alpha_i), {cmd:sfpanel} fits:
d 
d {cmd:ix)} the Schmidt and Sickles (1984) model in which alpha_i can be either fixed
d  or random.

d 'LEEBOUNDS': module for estimating Lee (2009) treatment effect bounds
d 
d  leebounds computes treatment effect bounds for samples with
d non-random sample selection/attrition as proposed by Lee (Review
d of Economic Studies, 2009). The lower and    upper bound,
d respectively, correspond to extreme assumptions about the missing
d information that are consistent with the observed data. As
d opposed to parametric approaches to correcting for sample
d selection bias, such as the classical Heckman (1979) estimator,
d Lee (2009) bounds rest on very few assumptions, i.e. random
d assignment of treatment and monotonicity. Monotonicity means that
d the treatment status affects selection in just one direction.
d That is, receiving a treatment makes selection either more or
d less likely for any observation. In technical terms, the approach
d rests on a trimming procedure. Either from below or from
d above, the group (treatment, control) that suffers less from
d sample attrition is trimmed at the quantile of the outcome
d variable that corresponds to the share of 'excess observations'
d in this group. Calculating group differentials in mean    outcome
d yields the lower and the upper bound, respectively, for the
d treatment effect depending on whether trimming is from below or
d above.  leebounds    assumes that it is unknown, a priori, which
d group (treatment, control) is subject to the higher selection
d probability and estimates this from data    (see Lee, 2009:1090). d

d 'MERGEMANY': module to merge many files
d 
d  mergemany is an extension to the command merge, providing a
d flexible way for many 'using' datasets to be merged into one
d final dataset.  Merges can be performed based upon a user-defined
d list of files, by using the numerical regularity of file names,
d or by including all datasets of a given type stored in a single
d directory.  mergemany also allows the user to import and merge an
d arbitrary number of .dta or non .dta files in a single step.

d newey. Its main capabilities: two-step feasible GMM estimation;
d continuously updated GMM estimation (CUE); LIML and k-class
d estimation; automatic output of the Hansen-Sargan or
d Anderson-Rubin statistic for overidentifying restrictions; C
d statistic test of exogeneity of subsets of instruments (orthog()
d option); kernel-based autocorrelation-consistent (AC) and
d heteroskedastic and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) estimation,
d with user-specified choice of kernel; Cragg's "heteroskedastic
d OLS" (HOLS) estimator; default reporting of large-sample
d statistics (z and chi-squared rather than t and F); small option
d to report small-sample statistics; first-stage regression
d reported with F-test of excluded instruments and R-squared with
d included instruments "partialled-out"; enhanced Kleibergen-Paap
d and Cragg-Donald tests for weak instruments, redundancy of
d instruments, significance of endogenous regressors; two-way
d clustering of standard errors;  Kiefer and Driscoll-Kraay
d standard errors. ivreg2 can also be used for ordinary least
d squares (OLS) estimation using the same command syntax as Stata's
d official regress and newey. This is version 3.1.06 of ivreg2,
d updated from that published in Stata Journal, 5(4), requiring
d Stata 10.1 or better. Stata 9.2 users may use ivreg29 (q.v.).

d rcheck.  Check sensitivity to alternative model specifications.
d Program by Kenneth L. Simons.
d resultsCheck runs your statistical model under many alternative
d specifications to see if your conclusions are robust under all the variants.
d More generally, it checks the range of values taken on by any expressions
d calculated using coefficient estimates, standard errors, p-values, R-squared
d values, etc.  The philosophy is a test-test-test approach: if you have no a
d priori reason to use one measure of a concept versus another, or to use one
d transformation versus another (cf. log vs. square root), or to include
d versus not include a potential control variable, then it would be sloppy to
d try just one or a few versions of the model and declare that you have found
d the truth.  Instead, you ought to check whether your results are robust to
d reasonable alternative specifications.  This program helps you with the
d process, so you can type one command and examine one set of results in place
d of many statistical analyses.

d as, for example, discussed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1985) and used

d uses all comparison observations within a predefined distance
d around  the propensity score or based on the Mahalanobis distance
d of the respective treated.  This allows for higher precision than
d fixed nearest neighbour matching in regions in  which many
d similar comparison observations are available. Also, it may lead
d to a smaller bias in regions where similar controls are sparse.
d In other words, instead of fixing  M globally, M is determined in

d xsmle.  Spatial Panel Data Models (version 1.3.2  21mar2013).
d 
d 
d {cmd:xsmle} fits fixed or random effects spatial models for balanced panel data.
d See {help mi} prefix command for the unbalanced case. A general specification
d for the spatial panel data model is:
d 
d y_it = tau*y_it-1 + rho*W*y_it + beta*X_it + D*Z_it*theta + a_i + gamma_t + v_it
d v_it = lambda*E*v_it + u_it
d 
d where u_it is a normally distributed error term, W is the spatial matrix for the
d autoregressive component, D the spatial matrix for the spatially lagged independent
d variables, E the spatial matrix for the idiosyncratic error component.
d a_i is the individual fixed or random effect and gamma_t is the time effect.
d 
d {cmd:i)} By setting theta=lambda=0 we have the SAR model with lagged dependent variable:
d 
d y_it = tau*y_it-1 + rho*W*y_it + beta*X_it + a_i + gamma_t + u_it
d 
d {cmd:ii)} By setting lambda=0 we have the SDM model with lagged dependent variable:
d 
d y_it = tau*y_it-1 + rho*W*y_it + beta*X_it + D*Z_it*theta + a_i + gamma_t + u_it
d 
d {cmd:model(sdm)} allows to use a different weighting matrix for the spatially lagged
d dependent variable (W) and the spatially lagged regressors (D) together with a
d different sets of explanatory (X_it) and spatially lagged regressors (Z_it).
d The default is to use W=D and X_it=Z_it.
d 
d {cmd:iii)} By setting theta=tau=0 we have the SAC model:
d 
d y_it = rho*W*y_it + beta*X_it + a_i + gamma_t + v_it
d v_it = lambda*E*v_it + u_it
d 
d {cmd:model(sac)} allows to use a different weighting matrix for the spatially lagged
d dependent variable (W) and the error term (E).
d 
d {cmd:iv)} By setting rho=theta=tau=0 we have the SEM model:
d 
d y_it = beta*X_it + a_i + gamma_t + v_it
d v_it = lambda*E*v_it + u_it
d 
d {cmd:v)} By setting rho=theta=tau=0 and adding a spatial matrix to the random effects
d we have the GSPRE model:
d 
d y_it = beta*X_it + a_i + v_it
d a_i = phi*W*a_i + mu_i
d v_it = lambda*E*v_it + u_it

d 'USEPACKAGE': module to find and install a list of user-written packages needed to run a do-file
d 
d  usepackage finds and installs user-written packages that are
d needed to run a do-file.  When sharing a do-file that contains
d calls to user-written commands from SSC or elsewhere, you can use
d usepackage to include a list of packages rather than writing a
d series of net install or ssc install commands to install a list
d of user-written packages (or instructing the user to find and
d install a list of packages via commands like findit or search).
d usepackage is particularly useful when user-written packages come
d from locations other than the SSC Archives because usepackage
d first searches the SSC and then if it does not find a match it
d searches other internet locations (e.g., those searched by net
d search by default), including but not limited to user-written

d 'XTABOND2': module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator
d 
d     xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data
d models. The first is the    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which
d is also available with xtabond without the two-step
d finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an
d augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
d fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
d (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
d that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
d period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
d condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
d first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
d own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
d other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
d conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
d differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
d the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
d often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
d variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
d (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
d added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
d brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
d predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
d instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
d Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
d for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
d Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
d called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
d Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
d their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
d estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
d variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
d two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
d downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
d  To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
d finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
d derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
d   efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
d Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
d the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10
d (25feb2008 update) or later can take advantage of speed
d improvements due to Mata.

d 'SFPANEL': module for panel data stochastic frontier models estimation
d 
d  The official Stata -xtfrontier- command allows the estimation of
d a Normal-Truncated Normal model with time-invariant inefficiency
d (Battese and Coelli 1988) and a time-varying version, named as
d time decay model, proposed by Battese and Coelli (1992).
d -sfpanel- allows to estimate a wider range of time-varying
d inefficiency models including the Cornwell et al. (1990) and Lee
d and Schmidt (1993) models, the flexible model of Kumbhakar
d (1990), the time decay and the inefficiency effects models of
d Battese and Coelli (1992, 1995) and the true fixed and
d random-effects models developed by Greene (2005). For the last
d two models, -sfpanel- allows different distributional
d assumptions, providing the modeling of both inefficiency location
d and scale parameters. Furthermore, the command allows the
d estimation of the random-effects time-invariant inefficiency
d models of Pitt and Lee (1981) and Battese and Coelli (1988), as
d well as the fixed-effects version of the Schmidt and Sickles
d (1984) model, characterized by no distributional assumptions on
d the inefficiency term. In addition, since the main objective of
d the stochastic frontier analysis is the estimation of
d inefficiency, we provide a post estimation command to compute
d (in)efficiency scores, as well as their confidence intervals
d (Jondrow et al. 1982; Battese and Coelli 1988; Horrace and
d Schmidt 1996). Finally, -sfpanel- allows also the simultaneous
d modeling of heteroscedasticity in the idiosyncratic error term.

d 'MTREATREG': module to fits models with multinomial treatments and continuous, count and binary outcomes using maximum simulated likelihood
d 
d mtreatreg fits models with multinomial treatments and continuous,
d count and binary outcomes using maximum simulated likelihood. The
d model considers the effect of an endogenously chosen
d multinomial-valued treatment on an outcome variable, conditional
d on two sets of independent variables.  The outcome variable can
d be continuous, binary or integer-valued while the treatment
d choice is assumed to follow a mixed multinomial logit
d distribution. The model is estimated using maximum simulated
d likelihood and the simulator uses Halton sequences.

d provide the new Stata command -xsmle-, which fits fixed and
d random-effects spatial models for balanced panel data for a wide
d range of specifications: Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR),
d Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), Spatial
d Autoregressive Model with Autoregressive Disturbances (SAC),
d Generalized Spatial Random-effects Model (GSPRE). -xsmle- allows
d to specify the weighting matrix as a Stata matrix or a -spmat-
d object. Furthermore, -xsmle- computes direct, indirect and total
d spatial effects according to LeSage (2008), implements Lee and Yu
d (2010) data transformation for fixed-effects models and may be
d used with the -mi- prefix command when the panel is unbalanced.

d 'REG2HDFE': module to estimate a Linear Regression Model with two High Dimensional Fixed Effects
d 
d  This command implements the algorithm of Guimaraes & Portugal
d for estimation of a linear regression model with two high
d dimensional fixed effects. The command is particularly suited for
d use with large data sets because you can "store" the transformed
d variables and reuse them in alternative specifications. The
d command is based on the algorithm presented in  Carneiro,
d Guimaraes and Portugal (2009) and explained in more detail in
d Guimaraes and Portugal (2009).

d 'TWFE': module to perform regressions with two-way fixed effects or match effects for large datasets
d 
d  twfe fits a linear regression model of depvar on indepvars
d including fixed effects for the units defined by id1(varname) and
d id2(varname).  If matcheffect is specified, fixed effects for the
d interaction of the two id variables are included.    In order to
d save memory, twfe will change the data in memory. It will replace
d the data in memory with a dataset containing the id variables,
d the estimates of the fixed effects (called "fe1", "fe2") and the
d match length ("mlength"). If matcheffect is specified additional
d variables for    the match id ("matchid") and the match fixed
d effect ("matchef") are created. See options disk and force for
d further info.    twfe is intended for estimation in large data
d sets, where constraints on memory and matsize make standard
d estimation difficult and time consuming.    Instead of solving
d (X'X)b=X'y by inverting X'X it solves the system by computing the
d slopes first, then using the conjugate gradient algorithm to
d compute the smaller set of fixed effects and finally solving for
d the other fixed effects recursively.

d 'SHEAFCOEF': module to compute sheaf coefficients
d 
d  sheafcoef is a post-estimation command that estimates sheaf
d coefficients (Heise, Sociological Methods and Research 1972). A
d sheaf coefficient assumes that a block of variables influence the
d dependent variable through a latent variable. This assumption is
d not tested, nor is it testable; a sheaf coefficient is just a
d different way of presenting the results from a model. Its main
d usefulness is in comparing the relative strength of the influence
d of several blocks of variables. For example, say we want to know
d what determines the probability of working non-standard hours
d (evenings, nights, and weekends) and we have a block of variables
d representing characteristics of the job and another block of
d variables representing the family situation of the respondent,
d and we want to say something about the relative importance of job
d characteristics versus family situation. In that case one could
d estimate a logit model with both blocks of variables and
d optionally some other control variables. After that one can use
d sheafcoef to display the effects of two latent variables, family
d background and job characteristics, which are both standardized
d to have a standard deviation of 1, and can thus be more easily
d compared.

d cid calculates confidence intervals (CIs) for means or

d of varname. In the second form, cid produces a CI for mean
d difference between varname1 and varname2.  Data are assumed to be
d paired, but unpaired changes this assumption. In the third form,
d cid gives a CI for the mean difference across the two groups
d defined by groupvar. Data are assumed paired, but unpaired
d reverses this. median calculates CI's as above, except for
d medians rather than for means. CI's are determined by rank-based
d methods as described in Gardner and Altman's (1989) book
d "Statistics with Confidence", pp. 74-79.  A normal approximation
d with a continuity correction of 0.5 is used, rather than tables
d of exact values.  The accuracy should be adequate when both
d groups have at least 5 observations.

d and Schmidt (1993) models, the flexible model of Kumbhakar
d (1990), the time decay and the inefficiency effects models of
d Battese and Coelli (1992, 1995) and the true fixed and
d random-effects models developed by Greene (2005). For the last
d two models, -sfpanel- allows different distributional
d assumptions, providing the modeling of both inefficiency location
d and scale parameters. Furthermore, the command allows the
d estimation of the random-effects time-invariant inefficiency
d models of Pitt and Lee (1981) and Battese and Coelli (1988), as
d well as the fixed-effects version of the Schmidt and Sickles
d (1984) model, characterized by no distributional assumptions on
d the inefficiency term. In addition, since the main objective of
d the stochastic frontier analysis is the estimation of
d inefficiency, we provide a post estimation command to compute
d (in)efficiency scores, as well as their confidence intervals
d (Jondrow et al. 1982; Battese and Coelli 1988; Horrace and
d Schmidt 1996). Finally, -sfpanel- allows also the simultaneous
d modeling of heteroscedasticity in the idiosyncratic error term.

d 
d  ivreg2h estimates an instrumental variables regression model
d providing the option to generate instruments using Lewbel's
d (J.Bus.Ec.Stat., 2012) method. This technique allows the
d identification of structural parameters in regression models with
d endogenous or  mismeasured regressors in the absence of
d traditional identifying information, such as external
d instruments or repeated measurements. Identification is achieved
d in this context  by having regressors that are uncorrelated with
d the product of heteroskedastic errors,  which is a feature of
d many models where error correlations are due to an unobserved
d common factor. Using this form of Lewbel's method, instruments
d may be constructed as simple functions of the model's data. This
d approach may thus be applied when no external instruments are
d available, or, alternatively,  used to supplement external
d instruments to improve the efficiency of the IV estimator.
d Supplementing external instruments can also allow Sargan-Hansen
d tests of the orthogonality conditions or overidentifying
d restrictions to be performed, which would not be available in the
d case of exact identification by external instruments. The

d 'ABAR': module to perform Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation
d 
d   abar performs the Arellano-Bond (1991) test for
d autocorrelation. The test was originally proposed for a
d particular linear Generalized Method of Moments  dynamic panel
d data estimator, but is quite general in its applicability--more
d general  than dwstat, durbina, bgodfrey, and xtserial. It can be
d applied to linear GMM regressions in general, and thus to
d ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least-squares (2SLS)
d regressions, which can be seen as special cases of linear GMM. It
d is appropriate for both time-series and cross-section time-series
d (panel) regressions. It can also be made consistent in the
d presence of various patterns of error covariance. Specifically,
d abar will run after regress, ivreg, ivreg2, and ivreg2, gmm in
d their "plain"  (homoskedastic), robust, and cluster variants. It
d will also run after newey and newey2. In the context of an
d Arellano-Bond GMM regression, which is run on first differences,
d AR(1) is to be expected, and therefore the Arellano-Bond AR(1)
d test result is usually ignored in that context. The AR(2) test on
d the residuals in first differences is used to detect AR(1) in the
d underlying levels variables. But in other contexts, such as
d simple OLS in levels, the AR(1) test is relevant. abar is not
d appropriate for fixed-effects regressions for dynamic models,
d assuming those are done via a mean-deviation transformation. This
d is because the Arellano-Bond AR() test assumes that
d right-hand-side variables are not "post-determined," i.e., not
d correlated with future errors. In a dynamic setting, future
d values of regressors can depend on future errors. And after the
d mean-deviations transformation, future values of the original
d regressors affect  current values of the transformed versions.

d 'EXPGEN': module to duplicate observations sorted in original order with generated variables
d 
d expgen is an extended version of expand. It replaces each
d observation in the current dataset with nc copies of the
d observation, sorted in the original order, where nc is equal to
d the integer part int(ncexp) of the required expression ncexp.
d expgen may also add new variables. These are newvarname1
d (containing the value of the expression ncexp), newvarname2
d (containing the sequential order of the original observation in
d the old data set), and newvarname3 (containing the sequential
d order of each copy in the set of copies generated from its
d original observation). If missing and/or zero is specified, then
d observations in the old data set with missing and/or non-positive
d values for int(ncexp) are each replaced by one observation in the
d new data set.

d etc. Both in/out forms are case-sensitive (except for the former
d case when running with option oldstx that may be needed

d 'XTABOND2': module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator
d 
d     xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data
d models. The first is the    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which
d is also available with xtabond without the two-step
d finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an
d augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
d fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
d (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
d that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
d period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
d condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
d first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
d own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
d other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
d conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
d differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
d the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
d often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
d variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
d (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
d added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
d brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
d predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
d instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
d Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
d for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
d Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
d called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
d Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
d their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
d estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
d variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
d two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
d downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
d  To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
d finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
d derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
d   efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
d Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
d the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10
d (25feb2008 update) or later can take advantage of speed
d improvements due to Mata.

d build by specific job-positions and ordered along time. Sequence
d data are data that contains one variable holding the elements,

d 'XTABOND2': module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator
d 
d     xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data
d models. The first is the    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which
d is also available with xtabond without the two-step
d finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an
d augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
d fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
d (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
d that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
d period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
d condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
d first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
d own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
d other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
d conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
d differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
d the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
d often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
d variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
d (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
d added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
d brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
d predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
d instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
d Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
d for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
d Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
d called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
d Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
d their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
d estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
d variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
d two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
d downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
d  To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
d finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
d derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
d   efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
d Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
d the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10

d 'CMP': module to implement conditional (recursive) mixed process estimator
d 
d  cmp estimates multi-equation, mixed process models, potentially
d with hierarchical random effects. "Mixed process" means that
d different equations can have different kinds of dependent
d variables. The choices are: continuous (like OLS), tobit (left-,
d right-, or bi-censored), probit, and ordered probit.
d "Conditional" means that the model can vary by observation. An
d equation can be dropped for observations for which it is not
d relevant--if, say, a worker retraining program is not offered in
d a city then the determinants of uptake cannot be modeled there.
d Or the type of dependent variable can vary by observation. A
d dependent variable in one equation can appear on the right side
d of another equation. Such dependencies must have a recursive
d structure if the dependencies are on censored variables as
d observed, meaning that they split the equations into stages. If
d the dependencies are on (latent) linear dependent variables, they
d can be recursive or simultaneous in structure. So cmp can fit
d many SUR, simultaneous equation, and IV models. cmp's modeling
d framework therefore embraces those of the official Stata commands
d  probit, ivprobit, treatreg, biprobit, tetrachoric, oprobit,
d mprobit, asmprobit, asroprobit, tobit, ivtobit, cnreg, intreg,
d truncreg, heckman, heckprob, xtreg, xtprobit, xttobit, xtintreg,
d in principle even regress, sureg, and reg3. It goes beyond them

d Program by Alexis Dinno.
d Support: alexis dot dinno at pdx dot edu
d Version: 1.6.1 (updated March 14, 2014)
d Distribution-Date: 14mar2014
d 
d This package includes {cmd:tostt} and {cmd:tostti} which perform t tests
d for mean equivalence, {cmd:tostpr} and {cmd:tostpri} which performs z
d tests for proportion equivalence, {cmd:tostsignrank} and {cmd:tostranksum}
d which perform approximate z tests for the nonparametric tests of stochastic
d equivalence in paired and unpaired data, respectively, and {cmd:tostmcc}
d which performs the specific z test of proportion equivalence corresponding to the (chi-square) McNemar's test of paired binary outcomes.
d 
d This package is written for STATA versions 8 - 13, however requests for a
d version compatible with versions of STATA earlier than v6 are untenable
d since I do not have access to the software.
d 
d All feature and bug requests are welcome and will be considered.
d 
d {cmd:HISTORY}
d 
d 14mar2014 (1.6.1)  added a help file for the tost package as a whole
d 
d 02mar2014 (1.6.0)  added wald-type z test of equivalence in paired binary
d                    data (i.e. the equivalence test counterpart to mcnemar's
d                    test) with documentation. minor tweaks to other tost
d                    output and help files.
d 
d 01mar2014 (1.5.0)  added equivalence tests based on the approximate z tests
d                    for the nonparametric signed-rank and rank sum tests.
d                    help files have been improved, and also reflect the new
d                    commands. tostpr output has been slightly improved.
d 
d 28feb2014 (1.4.0)  added the capability to specify asymmetric equivalence
d                    intervals using the new uppereqvlevel() option. improved
d                    help files and revised to reflect new capabilities.
d 
d 27feb2014 (1.3.1)  added a warning if tolerance levels are specified too low
d                    for the data to reject any null hypothesis of difference
d                    as large as that tolerance, and expanded on the math
d                    behind this warning in the documentation. the help files
d                    were also given other minor improvements. a bug in the
d                    tabled output values was corrected (specifically the diff

d                    options for two-sample tests of proportions using
d                    tostpr and tostpri. updated documentation.
d 
d 25feb2014 (1.2.5)  eliminated the liberal, strict and very strict options
d                    for specifying the equivalence levels with epsilon due to
d                    my misinterpreting some of the equivalence testing
d                    literature. the documentation has been updated to reflect

d                    absolute value signs were in the wrong places: actual
d                    estimates remain unchanged).
d 
d 21dec2013 (1.2.3)  removed the scaling feature on t tests of equivalence

d                    options. see help file for more information.
d 
d 03nov2013 (1.2.0)  significant update adding the ability to specify the
d                    equivalence threshold either in terms of the units of the

d                    of the t distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom
d                    for mean tests and the z distribution for proportion tests.

d 'XTABOND2': module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator
d 
d     xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data
d models. The first is the    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which
d is also available with xtabond without the two-step
d finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an
d augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
d fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
d (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
d that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
d period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
d condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
d first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
d own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
d other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
d conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
d differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
d the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
d often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
d variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
d (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
d added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
d brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
d predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
d instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
d Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
d for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
d Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
d called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
d Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
d their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
d estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
d variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
d two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
d downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
d  To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
d finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
d derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
d   efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
d Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
d the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10
d (25feb2008 update) or later can take advantage of speed

d 'SEQLOGIT': module to fit a sequential logit model
d 
d  seqlogit fits a sequential logit model. This model estimates the
d effect of the explanatory variables on the probabilities of
d passing a set of transitions. For example, given a highest
d achieved level of education the researcher studies the effect of
d socio-economic status on the probabilities of passing the
d different transitions between levels of education. The user can
d specify any decision tree as long as each level of the dependent
d variable (e.g. level of education) can be reached through one and
d only one sequence of transitions. If these levels have values
d (e.g. years of education) than this model also implies an effect
d of the explanatory variable on the highest achieved level. The
d program seqlogitdecomp, which is part of the seqlogit package,
d displays a graph that decomposes this effect on the highest
d achieved level into parts that measure the effect on the
d probabilities of passing the transitions and the importance of
d each transition.

d manuscript. Such tables are commonly used in medical manuscripts
d and generally include a collection of baseline characteristics
d which may be either continuous or categorical. The observations
d are often grouped, eg "treated" vs "controls", with a p-value

d 
d 
d {cmd:xsmle} fits fixed or random effects spatial models for balanced panel data.
d See {help mi} prefix command for the unbalanced case. A general specification
d for the spatial panel data model is:
d 
d y_it = tau*y_it-1 + rho*W*y_it + beta*X_it + D*Z_it*theta + a_i + gamma_t + v_it
d v_it = lambda*E*v_it + u_it
d 
d where u_it is a normally distributed error term, W is the spatial matrix for the
d autoregressive component, D the spatial matrix for the spatially lagged independent
d variables, E the spatial matrix for the idiosyncratic error component.
d a_i is the individual fixed or random effect and gamma_t is the time effect.
d 
d {cmd:i)} By setting theta=lambda=0 we have the SAR model with lagged dependent variable:
d 
d y_it = tau*y_it-1 + rho*W*y_it + beta*X_it + a_i + gamma_t + u_it
d 
d {cmd:ii)} By setting lambda=0 we have the SDM model with lagged dependent variable:
d 
d y_it = tau*y_it-1 + rho*W*y_it + beta*X_it + D*Z_it*theta + a_i + gamma_t + u_it
d 
d {cmd:model(sdm)} allows to use a different weighting matrix for the spatially lagged
d dependent variable (W) and the spatially lagged regressors (D) together with a
d different sets of explanatory (X_it) and spatially lagged regressors (Z_it).
d The default is to use W=D and X_it=Z_it.
d 
d {cmd:iii)} By setting theta=tau=0 we have the SAC model:
d

d 'XTABOND2': module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator
d 
d     xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data
d models. The first is the    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which
d is also available with xtabond without the two-step
d finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an
d augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
d fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
d (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
d that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
d period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
d condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
d first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
d own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
d other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
d conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
d differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
d the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
d often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
d variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
d (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
d added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
d brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
d predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
d instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
d Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
d for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
d Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
d called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
d Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
d their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
d estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
d variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
d two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
d downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
d  To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
d finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
d derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
d   efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
d Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
d the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10
d (25feb2008 update) or later can take advantage of speed

d 'INEQFAC': module to calculate inequality decomposition by factor components
d 
d ineqfac provides an exact decomposition of the inequality of
d total income into inequality contributions from each of the
d factor components of total income. ineqfac was designed as a tool
d for income distribution analysis in the case where the current
d sample contains observations on income components for each  of a
d set of income receiving units (e.g. families, households,
d persons).   In this case, facvars might include labour income,
d income from investments  and pensions, cash transfers, etc. See
d Shorrocks (1982b) and Jenkins (1995) for examples. ineqfac may
d also be applied to summarise and compare the riskiness of
d portfolios of wealth holdings: s_f, the "proportionate
d contribution of factor f to total inequality",  has exactly the
d same form as the "beta coefficient" used in finance analysis.

d ineqrbd performs regression-based decomposition of the inequality
d in depvar into the contributions accounted for by each of the

d  weakiv10 calculates weak-instrument-robust tests of the
d coefficients on the endogenous regressors in instrumental
d variables (IV) estimation of models with up to 2 endogenous
d regressors. weakiv10 supports estimation of linear IV models by
d ivregress, ivreg2 and ivreg2h, panel data linear IV estimation
d (fixed effects and first differences) by xtivreg and xtivreg2,
d and estimation of probit and tobit IV models by ivprobit and
d ivtobit. In an exactly-identified model with one instrument,
d weakiv10 reports the Anderson-Rubin (AR) test statistic. When the
d IV model is overidentified, weakiv10 also conducts the
d conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) test, the Lagrange multiplier
d K test, the J overidentification test, and a combination of the K
d and overidentification tests (the K-J test). Minimum
d Distance/Wald and LM versions of the tests are both supported.
d weakiv10 also provides graphing facilities for visual examination
d and presentation of rejection probabilities and confidence sets
d based on these tests. For models with 1 endogenous regressor,
d weakiv10 reports confidence intervals that are robust to weak
d identification. For models with 2 endogenous regressors, weakiv10
d constructs confidence sets and reports these using 2-D contour
d plots and 3-D surface plots. For linear IV models, weakiv10
d supports all the variance-covariance estimators supported by
d ivregress or ivreg2 (robust, cluster-robust, HAC, 2-way

d (fixed effects and first differences) by xtivreg and xtivreg2,
d dynamic panel data estimation by xtabond2, and estimation of
d probit and tobit IV models by ivprobit and ivtobit. In an
d exactly-identified model with one instrument, weakiv reports the
d Anderson-Rubin (AR) test statistic. When the IV model is
d overidentified, weakiv also conducts the conditional likelihood
d ratio (CLR) test, the Lagrange multiplier K test, the J
d overidentification test, and a combination of the K and
d overidentification tests (the K-J test). Minimum Distance/Wald
d and LM versions of the tests are both supported. weakiv also
d provides graphing facilities for visual examination and
d presentation of rejection probabilities and confidence sets based
d on these tests. For individual endogenous regressors, weakiv will
d report confidence intervals and graph rejection probabilities
d that are robust to weak identification. For 2 endogenous
d regressors, weakiv constructs confidence sets and reports these
d using 2-D contour plots and 3-D surface plots. For linear IV and
d panel data model models, weakiv supports all the
d variance-covariance estimators supported by ivregress, ivreg2 and
d xtabond2 (robust, cluster-robust, HAC, 2-way clustering, Kiefer
d and Driscoll-Kraay SEs, etc.). weakiv builds on and extends the
d command rivtest by Finlay and Magnusson (Stata Journal 9(3),
d 2009). weakiv requires Stata 11 or above. Users with Stata 10 are
d recommended to install weakiv10, an older version of weakiv

d 'ITSA': module to perform interrupted time series analysis for single and multiple groups
d 
d  itsa estimates the effect of an intervention when the outcome
d variable is ordered as a time series, and a number of
d observations are available in both pre- and post-intervention
d periods. The study design is generally referred to as an
d interrupted time series because the intervention is expected to
d "interrupt" the level and/or trend subsequent to its
d introduction. itsa is a wrapper program for, by default, newey,
d which produces Newey-West standard errors for coefficients
d estimated by OLS regression, or optionally prais, which uses the
d generalized least-squares method to estimate the parameters in a
d linear regression model in which the errors are assumed to follow
d a first-order autoregressive process. itsa estimates treatment
d effects for either a single treatment group (with pre- and
d post-intervention observations) or a multiple-group comparison
d (i.e., the single treatment group is compared with one or more
d control groups). Additionally, itsa can estimate treatment
d effects for multiple treatment periods.

d 
d  graph3d draws a three dimensional plot given a dataset of three
d variables. Moving, scaling, and 360 degree rotating over all axes
d is fully supported. Parallel projections can be generated,
d however, the perspective option allows the user to produce a
d perspective projection of the data. The user simply has to
d provide the three variables and plot3d will plot small black
d circles indicating each data point by default. Plot3d can handle
d even four variables: three variables are plotted along the three
d axes, the fourth is represented by different colors/shapes of the
d markers. Three predefined colorschemes allow the user to
d emphasize how data points move along the specified axis. The
d marker colors and size can - among other options - be chosen
d according to the preferences of the user. Using Plot3d it is
d straightforward to produce animations to visualize the big
d picture. Typical use of the plot3d command include, to take an
d example from economics, to depict a budget constraint of a couple
d household. Other examples are: to use plot3d to illustrate how
d the utility level of a utility function depends on two arguments
d or to plot the indifference plane of a utility function that

d 'SURFACE': module to draw a 3D wireform surface plot
d 
d   The surface command attempts to draw a wireframe plot from
d three variables.  var1 specifies the x-coordinate, var2 the
d y-coordinate and var3 the  z-coordinate. Alternatively the
d function can draw a circle at each  point and add a straight line
d going down to the lowest point.  This function can handle data
d that is not in the form of a matrix of values.  However if there
d are too many x- and y- values the function will attempt  to round
d the dataset values into a more reasonable spread of values. This
d will result in very messy figures. However in such a case it is
d the  impression that is needed. Many other statistical packages
d require a full  matrix of values. This is not a problem for the
d nowire option.  At present the state of rotating the diagram is
d limited to interchanging the axes. This is an update of the
d routine published in STB 51 (gr39). Users of Stata 10 may use
d surface; for earlier versions of Stata, use surface7.

d 'XTABOND2': module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator
d 
d     xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data
d models. The first is the    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which
d is also available with xtabond without the two-step
d finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an
d augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
d fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
d (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
d that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
d period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
d condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
d first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
d own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
d other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
d conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
d differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
d the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
d often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
d variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
d (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
d added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
d brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
d predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
d instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
d Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
d for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
d Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
d called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
d Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
d their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
d estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
d variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
d two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
d downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
d  To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
d finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
d derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
d   efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
d Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
d the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10
d (25feb2008 update) or later can take advantage of speed
d improvements due to Mata.

d recodes variables accordingly,  labvalch3 changes text in value
d labels, labvalcl clears value labels of  null strings, labvalpool
d pools sets of value labels, labvars labels a list of varibles,
d txtlabdef defines value labels from a text file and  uselab lists
d value labels together with variables using them. labcpy defines
d newlblname as a modified copy of oldlblname. labdeval defines a
d value label and attaches it to a list of variables.  labren
d changes value label names.  labmvs changes numeric values
d associated with strings to extended  missing values. Numeric
d values are changed to successive extended  missing value codes,
d starting with .a. Thus, the numeric value  associated with the
d first string specified, will be coded .a, the value  associated
d with the second string, .b and so on. Value labels are  modified
d accordingly. labgen2 creates a new variable and labels it. The
d syntax is the same as  with generate with the exception, that
d either a variable label, or  option definition is specified
d additionally. labascii defines value labels from a plain text
d file that contains only  ASCII characters. In filename each line,
d starting with a valid value  label name, marks the beginning of a
d new value label. The lines in  between define the integer-to-text
d mappings. Lines starting with  non-integer numbers are skipped.
d Optionally a do-file, containing the value label definitions, is
d created. labrecode modifies value labels and recode variables
d they are attached to.

d 'FITSTAT': module to compute fit statistics for single equation regression models
d 
d fitstat is a post-estimation command that computes a variety of
d measures of fit for many kinds of regression models. It works
d after the following: clogit, cnreg, cloglog, intreg, logistic,
d logit, mlogit, nbreg, ocratio, ologit, oprobit, poisson, probit,
d regress, zinb, and zip.  With the saving() and using() options,
d it can also be used to compare fit measures for two different
d models. For all models, fitstat reports the log-likelihoods of
d the full and intercept-only models, the deviance (D), the
d likelihood ratio chi-square (G2), Akaike's Information Criterion
d (AIC), AIC*N, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and BIC'.
d For all models except regress, fitstat reports McFadden's R2,
d McFadden's adjusted R2, the maximum likelihood R2, and Cragg &
d Uhler's R2.  These measures all equal R2 for OLS regression.
d fitstat reports R2 and the adjusted R2 after regress. fitstat
d reports the regular and adjusted count R2 for categorical data
d models. For ordered or binary logit or probit models, as well as
d models for censored data (tobit, cnreg, or intreg), it also
d reports McKelvey and Zavonia's R2. In addition, it reports
d Efron's R2 for logit or probit. This is version 1.6.4 of the
d software.

d 'CMP': module to implement conditional (recursive) mixed process estimator
d 
d  cmp estimates multi-equation, mixed process models, potentially
d with hierarchical random effects. "Mixed process" means that
d different equations can have different kinds of dependent
d variables. The choices are: continuous (like OLS), tobit (left-,
d right-, or bi-censored), probit, and ordered probit.
d "Conditional" means that the model can vary by observation. An
d equation can be dropped for observations for which it is not
d relevant--if, say, a worker retraining program is not offered in
d a city then the determinants of uptake cannot be modeled there.
d Or the type of dependent variable can vary by observation. A
d dependent variable in one equation can appear on the right side
d of another equation. Such dependencies must have a recursive
d structure if the dependencies are on censored variables as
d observed, meaning that they split the equations into stages. If
d the dependencies are on (latent) linear dependent variables, they
d can be recursive or simultaneous in structure. So cmp can fit
d many SUR, simultaneous equation, and IV models. cmp's modeling
d framework therefore embraces those of the official Stata commands
d  probit, ivprobit, treatreg, biprobit, tetrachoric, oprobit,
d mprobit, asmprobit, asroprobit, tobit, ivtobit, cnreg, intreg,
d truncreg, heckman, heckprob, xtreg, xtprobit, xttobit, xtintreg,
d in principle even regress, sureg, and reg3. It goes beyond them
d in offering far more flexibility in model construction. The
d routine runs under Stata 10 or later, faster under Stata 11.2 or
d later.

d 'SFPANEL': module for panel data stochastic frontier models estimation
d 
d  The official Stata -xtfrontier- command allows the estimation of
d a Normal-Truncated Normal model with time-invariant inefficiency
d (Battese and Coelli 1988) and a time-varying version, named as
d time decay model, proposed by Battese and Coelli (1992).
d -sfpanel- allows to estimate a wider range of time-varying
d inefficiency models including the Cornwell et al. (1990) and Lee
d and Schmidt (1993) models, the flexible model of Kumbhakar
d (1990), the time decay and the inefficiency effects models of
d Battese and Coelli (1992, 1995) and the true fixed and
d random-effects models developed by Greene (2005). For the last
d two models, -sfpanel- allows different distributional
d assumptions, providing the modeling of both inefficiency location
d and scale parameters. Furthermore, the command allows the
d estimation of the random-effects time-invariant inefficiency
d models of Pitt and Lee (1981) and Battese and Coelli (1988), as
d well as the fixed-effects version of the Schmidt and Sickles
d (1984) model, characterized by no distributional assumptions on
d the inefficiency term. In addition, since the main objective of
d the stochastic frontier analysis is the estimation of
d inefficiency, we provide a post estimation command to compute
d (in)efficiency scores, as well as their confidence intervals
d (Jondrow et al. 1982; Battese and Coelli 1988; Horrace and
d Schmidt 1996). Finally, -sfpanel- allows also the simultaneous
d modeling of heteroscedasticity in the idiosyncratic error term.

d 'CLUSTSE': module to estimate the statistical significance of parameters when the data is clustered with a small number of clusters
d 
d  clustse gives researchers several options for estimating the
d statistical significance of parameters when the data is clustered
d with a small number of clusters.  The default method of the
d program is the cluster adjusted t-statistics (CATs), which are
d described in Ibgragimov & Muller (2010).  This procedure runs the
d model inside of each cluster and uses the standard error of the
d parameter estimates across the clusters to make statistical
d inference.  The program also gives the option to perform the
d pairs cluster bootstrap-t procedure, as described by Cameron,
d Gelbach, & Miller (2008) and implemented by the program
d "clusterbs". Finally, the program gives the option for linear
d models to perform the wild cluster bootstrap-t procedure, as
d described by Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller (2008) and implemented by
d the program "cgmwildboot" created by Judson Caskey.  Esarey &
d Menger (forthcoming) show that these procedures provide adequate
d power and desirable false rejection rates for performing
d statistical inference, even for data with small numbers of
d clusters or clusters of uneven size. clustse implements fixed
d effects options for the cluster-adjusted t-statistics procedure,
d and allows the clustse program to call the updated clusterbs
d program appropriately as an option. The program is updated to
d handle omitted variables and failed models in a way that matches
d the sister program for R.  Now, the program will retain cluster
d estimates with omitted variables but omit the affected variables
d from the reported results under the default options. Under the
d option force(yes), the program will drop cluster estimates for
d all variables if any one variable is omitted from the model.
d This update also addresses an error in the calculation of
d t-statistics caused by omitted variables.  Furthermore, the
d program is updated to return more descriptive error messages if
d the procedure fails or if needed programs are not installed.

d 'LEANOUT': module to produce lean output formatting for estimation results
d 
d Regression output from Stata's regress command provides much
d output that is often not needed on every output screen; in
d addition, it does not allow for seeing results with the
d appropriate number of digits; finally it provides a t-statistic
d and a p-value for the test of the null hypothesis that each
d coefficient (and all coefficients) are zero. Typing leanout:
d regress limits output to regression coefficients (to a specified
d number of decimal places, with the default being nn.d), standard
d errors and confidence intervals with the only summary measures
d being an estimate of standard error of the residuals and the
d number of observations. This only affects screen output; all
d statistics computed by regress and all post-estimation commands
d work as before. \emph{leanout} may work before other routines
d that produce regression-like output, such as probit or logit, but
d no claim is made that it interacts nicely with all such programs.
d The basis for leanout is in Beck, "Making regression and related
d output more helpful to users" available at

d 'CLUSTSE': module to estimate the statistical significance of parameters when the data is clustered with a small number of clusters
d 
d  clustse gives researchers several options for estimating the
d statistical significance of parameters when the data is clustered
d with a small number of clusters.  The default method of the
d program is the cluster adjusted t-statistics (CATs), which are
d described in Ibgragimov & Muller (2010).  This procedure runs the
d model inside of each cluster and uses the standard error of the
d parameter estimates across the clusters to make statistical
d inference.  The program also gives the option to perform the
d pairs cluster bootstrap-t procedure, as described by Cameron,
d Gelbach, & Miller (2008) and implemented by the program
d "clusterbs". Finally, the program gives the option for linear
d models to perform the wild cluster bootstrap-t procedure, as
d described by Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller (2008) and implemented by
d the program "cgmwildboot" created by Judson Caskey.  Esarey &
d Menger (forthcoming) show that these procedures provide adequate
d power and desirable false rejection rates for performing
d statistical inference, even for data with small numbers of
d clusters or clusters of uneven size. clustse implements fixed
d effects options for the cluster-adjusted t-statistics procedure,
d and allows the clustse program to call the updated clusterbs
d program appropriately as an option. The program is updated to
d handle omitted variables and failed models in a way that matches
d the sister program for R.  Now, the program will retain cluster
d estimates with omitted variables but omit the affected variables
d from the reported results under the default options. Under the
d option force(yes), the program will drop cluster estimates for
d all variables if any one variable is omitted from the model.
d This update also addresses an error in the calculation of
d t-statistics caused by omitted variables.  Furthermore, the
d program is updated to return more descriptive error messages if
d the procedure fails or if needed programs are not installed.

d 'CLUSTERBS': module to perform a pairs symmetric cluster bootstrap-t procedure
d 
d  clusterbs performs a pairs symmetric cluster bootstrap-t
d procedure for estimating the statistical significance of
d relationships when the data is clustered with a small number of
d clusters.  This program uses a procedure described in Cameron,
d Gelbach, & Miller (2008) wherein the null distribution of the
d t-statistic is estimated by running the model in a series of
d bootstrap samples, where the data is sampled with replacement by
d cluster for each bootstrap iteration.  "clusterbs" is intended to
d be used for accurate statistical inference about one or more
d parameters of interest when the data is clustered with a small
d number of clusters, or a moderate number of clusters with uneven
d size.  It does not allow for post-estimation commands and does
d not return standard errors. clusterbs allows the pairs cluster
d bootstrap program to run fixed effects models.  These can be
d specified as cluster (where fixed effects are applied to each
d cluster), "inside" (where fixed effects are applied to an
d indicator inside of each cluster), and "external" (where fixed
d effects are given to an indicator separate from the clustering
d structure).

d 
d  The cem package provides a Stata implementation of coarsened

d treated and control groups.  Coarsened exact matching is faster,
d is easier to use and understand,  requires fewer assumptions, is
d more easily automated, and possesses more  attractive statistical
d properties for many applications than do existing  matching
d methods. In coarsened exact matching, users temporarily coarsen
d their  data, exact match on these coarsened data, and then run
d their analysis on  the uncoarsened, matched data. Coarsened exact
d matching bounds the degree  of model dependence and causal effect
d estimation error by ex ante user choice,  is monotonic imbalance
d bounding (so that reducing the maximum imbalance on  one variable
d has no effect on others), does not require a separate procedure
d to restrict data to common support, meets the congruence
d principle,  is approximately invariant to measurement error,
d balances all nonlinearities and  interactions in sample (i.e.,
d not merely in expectation), and works with  multiply imputed
d datasets. Other matching methods inherit many of the coarsened
d exact matching method's properties when applied to further match

d 'XTABOND2': module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator
d 
d     xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data
d models. The first is the    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which
d is also available with xtabond without the two-step
d finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an
d augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
d fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
d (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
d that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
d period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
d condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
d first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
d own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
d other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
d conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
d differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
d the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
d often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
d variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
d (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
d added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
d brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
d predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
d instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
d Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
d for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
d Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
d called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
d Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
d their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
d estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
d variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
d two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
d downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
d  To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
d finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
d derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
d   efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
d Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
d the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10
d (25feb2008 update) or later can take advantage of speed
d improvements due to Mata.

d 'BOOTTEST': module to provide fast execution of the wild bootstrap with null imposed
d 
d  boottest is a post-estimation command that offers fast execution
d of the wild bootstrap (Wu 1986) with null imposed, as recommended
d by Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) for estimates with
d clustered standard errors and few clusters. It also performs the
d score bootstrap (Kline and Santos 2012), which adapts the
d wild approach to Maximum Likelihood estimators. Two wrappers,
d waldtest and scoretest, give easy access to the classical Wald
d (1943) and Rao (1948) score/Lagrange multiplier tests. boottest
d works after regress, cnsreg, ivreg, ivregress, ivreg2 and most
d Stata ML-based estimation commands. boottest offers inference
d based on multi-way clustering after many Stata estimation
d commands that do not otherwise support it. When bootstrapping, it
d offers a choice of Rademacher, Mammen (1993), Webb (2014), and
d standard normal weights. boottest requires Stata version 11.2 or
d later and runs fastest in version 13 or later.

d 'MYLABELS': module for axis labels or ticks on transformed scales or for daily dates
d 
d mylabels and myticks generate axis labels and ticks on
d transformed scales. Their use is best explained by example. You
d draw a graph and one axis is on a transformed square root scale.
d You wish the axis labels to show untransformed values. For some
d values this is easy; for example, ylabel(0 1 2 "4" 3 "9" 4 "16" 5
d "25") says use "4" as label for 2, and so forth. For other values
d and/or other transformations the conversion may be more difficult
d to do in your head. The idea behind mylabels is that you feed it
d the numeric labels you want shown and the transformation being
d used. It will then place the appropriate specification in a local
d macro which you name. You may then use that local macro as part
d of a later graphics command. The idea behind myticks is similar.
d  mydays displays a formatted list of specified days that lie
d within the range of a tsset daily date variable describing a time
d series and puts the numeric version of that list in a specified
d local macro. The result may be useful for specifying axis label
d or tick positions on graphs of time series. mydays requires Stata

d 'XTDPDML': module to estimate Dynamic Panel Data Models using Maximum Likelihood
d 
d  Panel data make it possible both to control for unobserved
d confounders and to include lagged, endogenous regressors. Trying
d to do both at the same time, however, leads to serious estimation
d difficulties. In the econometric literature, these problems have
d been solved by using lagged instrumental variables together with
d the generalized method of moments (GMM). In Stata, commands such
d as xtabond and xtdpdsys have been used for these models. xtdpdml
d addresses the same problems via maximum likelihood estimation
d implemented with Stata's structural equation modeling (sem)
d command. The ML (sem) method is substantially more efficient than
d the GMM method when the normality assumption is met and suffers
d less from finite sample biases. xtdpdml greatly simplifies the
d SEM model specification process; makes it possible to test and
d relax many of the constraints that are typically embodied in
d dynamic panel models; unlike most related methods, allows for the
d inclusion of time-invariant variables in the model; takes
d advantage of Stata's ability to use full information maximum
d likelihood (FIML) for dealing with missing data; provides an
d overall goodness of fit measure by default and provides easy
d access to others; and can also generate code for use with Mplus.

d 
d  This package is a set of 12 commands designed to a) collect
d online financial data, b) optimize portfolios, c) simulate
d portfolios, and d) backtest portfolios. The 12 commands are the
d following:  1) returnsyh - gets prices and trade volume of a list
d of stocks from Yahoo Finance, computes simple and continuously
d compounded returns, and integrates the data in one dataset  2)
d meanrets - calculates the expected simple returns of a historical
d series of continuously compounded returns or simple returns.
d Expected returns can also be calculated using weights from other
d variable or using the exponentially weighted moving average
d (EWMA) method.   3) varrets - calculates the variance-covariance
d matrix of a series of continuously compounded returns. The
d variance-covariance matrix can also be estimated using weights
d from a variable or using the exponentially weighted moving
d average (EWMA) method.   4) gmvport - calculates the global
d minimum variance portfolio of a set of continuously compounded
d returns following Portfolio Theory.    5) mvport - calculates
d the minimum variance portfolio given a required return following
d Portfolio Theory. 6) ovport - calculates the optimal variance
d portfolio that lies in the Capital Market Line.    7) efrontier -
d generates and graph two efficient frontiers: with and without
d allowing for short sales.    8) cmline - generates and graph the
d efficient frontier along with the capital market line when adding
d a risk-free asset.  9) simport - simulates random portfolios
d inside the portfolio frontier 10) holdingrets  calculates the
d holding period return of one or more price variables of a sorted
d time series dataset 11) backtest - performs a backtest of a
d financial portfolio. It calculates the holding period return of a
d specific portfolio 12) cbacktest  performs a cumulative
d backtest of a financial portfolio. For each time period, a
d holding return is calculated. It also graphs the cumulative
d holding period return of the portfolio for all periods. The
d optimization commands gmvport, ovport, efrontier, and cmline
d allow for weight constraints such as minimum and/or maximum
d weights for each asset. They also allow to use any
d variance-covariance matrix and any vector of expected asset
d returns. The variance-covariance matrix and the vector of
d expected returns can be calculated using the EWMA method. In
d addition, these commands performs risk decomposition for each
d portfolio asset using Eulers theorem of decomposition for
d homogenous functions.

d 'FTOOLS': module to provide alternatives to common Stata commands optimized for large datasets
d 
d  ftools consists of a Mata file and several Stata commands: The
d Mata file creates identifiers (factors) from variables by using
d hash functions instead of sorting the data, so it runs in time
d O(N) and not in O(N log N). The Stata commands exploit this to
d avoid sort operations,  at the cost of being slower for small
d datasets (mainly because of the cost involved in moving data from
d Stata to Mata). Implemented commands are fcollapse, fegen group,
d and fsort. Note that most of the capabilities of levels and
d contract are already supported by these commands. Possible
d commands include more egen functions and merge and reshape
d alternatives.

d 'WEAKIV': module to perform weak-instrument-robust tests and confidence intervals for instrumental-variable (IV) estimation of linear, probit and tobit models
d 
d  weakiv calculates weak-instrument-robust tests of the
d coefficients on the endogenous regressors in instrumental
d variables (IV) estimation of models with any number of endogenous
d regressors. weakiv supports estimation of linear IV models by
d ivregress, ivreg2 and ivreg2h, panel data linear IV estimation
d (fixed effects and first differences) by xtivreg and xtivreg2,
d dynamic panel data estimation by xtabond2, and estimation of
d probit and tobit IV models by ivprobit and ivtobit. In an
d exactly-identified model with one instrument, weakiv reports the
d Anderson-Rubin (AR) test statistic. When the IV model is
d overidentified, weakiv also conducts the conditional likelihood
d ratio (CLR) test, the Lagrange multiplier K test, the J
d overidentification test, and a combination of the K and
d overidentification tests (the K-J test). Minimum Distance/Wald
d and LM versions of the tests are both supported. weakiv also
d provides graphing facilities for visual examination and
d presentation of rejection probabilities and confidence sets based
d on these tests. For individual endogenous regressors, weakiv will
d report confidence intervals and graph rejection probabilities
d that are robust to weak identification. For 2 endogenous
d regressors, weakiv constructs confidence sets and reports these
d using 2-D contour plots and 3-D surface plots. For linear IV and
d panel data model models, weakiv supports all the
d variance-covariance estimators supported by ivregress, ivreg2 and
d xtabond2 (robust, cluster-robust, HAC, 2-way clustering, Kiefer
d and Driscoll-Kraay SEs, etc.). weakiv builds on and extends the
d command rivtest by Finlay and Magnusson (Stata Journal 9(3),
d 2009). weakiv requires Stata 11 or above. Users with Stata 10 are

d To install from this site, first move to the working directory you
d intend to use for DEA analysis.  Then click below on {cmd:install} and then
d on {cmd:get files}.
d To run {cmd:dea}, first open your data file with Stata.
d Then, in your Stata command window, type in {cmd:ldea}.
d Each time you open Stata and intend to run {cmd:dea}, you must first run {cmd:ldea}.
d Now run {cmd:dea} command: see the PDF of "Data Envelopment Analysis" for details.

d 'FTOOLS': module to provide alternatives to common Stata commands optimized for large datasets
d 
d  ftools consists of a Mata file and several Stata commands: The
d Mata file creates identifiers (factors) from variables by using
d hash functions instead of sorting the data, so it runs in time
d O(N) and not in O(N log N). The Stata commands exploit this to
d avoid sort operations,  at the cost of being slower for small
d datasets (mainly because of the cost involved in moving data from
d Stata to Mata). Implemented commands are fcollapse, fegen group,
d and fsort. Note that most of the capabilities of levels and
d contract are already supported by these commands. Possible
d commands include more egen functions and merge and reshape
d alternatives.

d 'VCE2WAY': module to adjust a Stata command's standard errors for two-way clustering
d 
d      -vce2way- is a module to adjust an existing Stata estimation
d command's standard errors for two-way clustering.  The module
d works with any Stata command which allows one-way clustering in
d each dimension of interest separately via -vce(cluster varname)-
d option.  The results are compatible with the underlying command's
d postestimation tools that make use of -ereturn- matrix e(V)
d including -test-, -nlcom-, -margins- to name a few.

d 'POPARMS': module for potential outcome parameter estimation
d 
d  The poparms command that implements two semiparametric
d estimators for multivalued treatment effects discussed in
d Cattaneo (J. Econometrics, 2010). The first is a properly
d reweighted inverse-probability weighted estimator and the second
d is an efficient-influence-function estimator which can be
d interpreted as having the double-robust property.  Our
d implementation jointly estimates means and quantiles of the
d potential-outcome distributions allowing for multiple, discrete
d treatment levels. These estimators are then used to estimate a
d variety of multivalued treatment effects.

d 'WHEREIS': module to keep track of ancillary programs and files
d 
d  Stata programs that use external programs or files that are not
d in the adopath, for example the pandoc document converter, need
d to know the location of the resource. The -whereis- command helps
d users and developers alike by maintaining a directory of programs
d and files. The user stores the full path to the resource by
d typing in Stata -whereis name location- using a unique name and
d the full path. A program that needs the resource calls -whereis
d name- and retrieves the location from a macro -r(name)- named
d after the resource. An advantage over the alternative of storing
d file locations in global macros in profile.do is that -whereis-
d checks that the file is indeed at the specified location. For
d more information, including tips for users and notes for
d developers, see the help file or visit

d within or between element tags, etc...). To see how these objects

d 'MARKSTAT': module to support literate data analysis using Stata and Markdown

d results with comments and annotations written in Markdown,
d producing by default a web page. If a LaTeX installation is
d available, -markstat- can produce a PDF file from exactly the
d same input script. The command works by separating the code from
d the narrative, running the code through Stata, translating the
d narrative from Markdown to HTML or LaTeX using Pandoc, and then
d weaving the output files together. This avoids tedious cutting
d and pasting, and promotes reproducible research.  The command
d puts a high premium on the simplicity of the input file, which
d emphasizes readability much in the spirit of Markdown itself. It
d supports Stata and Mata inline code, strict code blocks with an
d option to hide the commands, and mathematical equations. It can
d also handle citations, resolving them using a BiBTeX database and
d listing them at the end of the document. The command is described
d in a forthcoming Stata Journal article, and is supported by a
d website at http://data.princeton.edu/stata/markdown, which
d includes installation instructions, documentation, examples, and
d a comparison with the new tools in Stata 15.

d 'INTEXT': module to read text files into string variables
d 
d The intext package inputs arbitrary text files into string
d variables  in the memory, without removing leading and trailing
d blanks (as infix does). intext contains 2 programs, intext and
d tfconcat. intext inputs a single text  file into a list of
d generated string variables, generating enough variables  to
d contain the longest input text line (including leading and
d trailing blanks). tfconcat concatenates a list of arbitrary text
d files into a new Stata data set  in memory, overwriting any
d previous data. The new data set contains a list of  string
d variables (as generated by intext), and also, optionally,
d additional  variables, indicating, for each observation, its
d input text file of origin and/or  its sequential order as a line
d within its input text file of origin. Therefore, tfconcat is like
d dsconcat, except that it concatenates text files instead of
d Stata data sets. intext is an inverse of outfile,runtogether,
d because the  generated string variables created by intext can be
d output using outfile,runtogether to produce a duplicate of the
d original file. Therefore,   intext enables Stata programs to read
d Stata programs, just as outfile,runtogether  enables Stata
d programs to write Stata programs.

d 'GEO2XY': module to convert latitude and longitude to xy using map projections
d 
d  geo2xy converts geographic latitude and longitude to cartesian
d coordinates (x,y) using map projection transformations. The
d default projection is a Web Mercator, which is the same used by
d most web mapping applications (Google Maps, Bing Maps, etc.). As
d an option, -geo2xy- can generate Tissot's indicatrices (grid of
d circles) which, when overlaid on a map of the projected
d coordinates, help visualize the distortions of the chosen
d projection. With projected coordinates, high quality maps can be
d produced using standard Stata graph commands or with user-written
d commands like -spmap-.
